5</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The Sermons which make up this volume were preached at Malvern, in 1866,
at, and immediately after, the opening services of the Wesleyan Chapel
there.</p>
<p>This beautiful and commodious building owes its erection to the piety
and energy of the Rev. W. M. <span class="smcap">Punshon</span>, who, in
the year 1862, proposed by Lectures, and otherwise, to raise a fund for
building Wesleyan Chapels in places of summer resort.</p>
<p>This proposition was well responded to by Mr. <span
class="smcap">Punshon&rsquo;s</span> friends, and the Wesleyan public, and
forty thousand pounds have already been expended in the erection of new
Chapels at Ilfracombe, Dawlish, the Lizard, Brighton, Weymouth, Eastbourne,
Walmer, Folkestone, Bournemouth, Blackpool, Lancing, Llandudus, Rhyl,
Saltburn, Bray, Matlock, <i>Malvern</i>, Keswick, Bowness, and the Isle of
Wight.&nbsp; Others are in progress.</p>
<p>These Sermons are published with the consent of the several preachers,
but it must be stated that they were <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>preached without any view
to publication, and now appear in print, nearly word for word, as they were
delivered, extempore, from the pulpit.&nbsp; Some of them, indeed, have
never been committed to writing by the authors; for instance, of the
beautiful sermon of Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, &ldquo;not a
word&rdquo; was written by him either before or since its delivery.</p>
<p>This will account for the fact that the subjects are not treated with
any degree of scientific exactness, as essays might require; but in a
manner intended to suggest useful thoughts to serious audiences.</p>
<p>Although myself of the Church of England, I have had many opportunities,
during the past thirty-five years, of hearing discourses from Wesleyan
ministers, and making personal acquaintance with them; and I believe the
following Sermons are a fair specimen of the Wesleyan teaching in this
country.</p>
<p>Why should not the Church of England and the great Wesleyan body be
united?&nbsp; Circumstances are entirely altered since Wesley, and his
coadjutors, were compelled to run away from the Church of England.&nbsp;
Now, thank God, the majority of our clergy, like the Wesleyan ministers,
are zealous, and energetic, and <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>evangelical men; popular in the style of their
addresses, distinguished by the vigour of their pastoral ministrations, and
incessant in them; paternal in their care of the poor, of broad and social
Christian sympathies, and earnestly pursuing the secular and religious
education of the young.&nbsp; Why should not the priests of the Church of
England and the ordained Wesleyan ministers be permitted to exchange
pulpits as they may think fit?&nbsp; There is little danger that a Wesleyan
minister would proclaim unsound doctrine.&nbsp; Such an evil is much more
shortly and sharply rectified by Wesleyan discipline, which the Courts of
Law uphold, than by any mere legal action to which the Church of England is
bound.</p>
<p>May it please God, by His Holy Spirit, to make these Sermons effectual
for the spreading of His truth and the quickening of His people.</p>

LIVELY STONES.<br />
REV. W. MORLEY PUNSHON.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> ii. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a manifest reference in the fourth verse to the personage
alluded to in Psalm cxviii. 22, 23: &ldquo;The stone which the builders
refused is become the head stone of the corner.&nbsp; This is the
Lord&rsquo;s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this
passage is applied by Christ to himself in Matthew xxi. 42: &ldquo;Jesus
saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the
builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the
Lord&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Apostle therefore places the beginning of any connection with Christianity
in coming to Christ, and assures believers that in their union with Him
alone consists the fulness of their dignity <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and privilege.&nbsp;
And there is no truth that will more readily be acknowledged, or receive a
heartier acquiescence from the heart of a believer.&nbsp; What could we do
without Jesus?&nbsp; In our every necessity He is our &ldquo;refuge and
strength,&rdquo; in our perils He compasses us about with songs of
deliverance, his life is our perfect example, his death is our perfect
atonement.&nbsp; Well might the Apostle interrupt the course of his
argument with the grateful apostrophe, &ldquo;Unto you, therefore, which
believe, He is precious;&rdquo; and exhort them &ldquo;that ye should show
forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into his
marvellous light.&rdquo;&nbsp; The text presents us with topics of
meditation worthy of our prayerful study, as it reveals to us&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Character</span>.<br />
II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Privilege</span>.<br />
III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Duty of Believers</span>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; You observe that in the text believers are presented as a
spiritual house and a holy priesthood; two different illustrations, which,
if you translate the word here rendered &ldquo;house&rdquo; by the more
sacred word &ldquo;temple,&rdquo; will be found to have the same religious
significance, and a close connection with each other.&nbsp; Coming to <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Christ as
the foundation-stone of the building, &ldquo;disallowed indeed of men, but
chosen of God, and precious,&rdquo; the Church rises into a spiritual
temple.&nbsp; From Christ, the great High Priest, &ldquo;consecrated after
no carnal commandment,&rdquo; believers rise into a holy priesthood by a
majestic investiture that is higher than the ordination of Aaron.&nbsp;
There are two points in the character of the ransomed Church which are
illustrated in these words:&mdash;<i>spirituality</i> and
<i>holiness</i>.</p>
<p>Take the first thought, spirituality.&nbsp; They are lively or living
stones, built up into a spiritual house.&nbsp; Any one who thoughtfully
observes the successive ages of the world&rsquo;s history, will not fail to
discover that each generation of men has in some important particulars
progressed upon its predecessor.&nbsp; There has been not only an
accumulation of the treasures of thought and knowledge but an increase of
the capacity to produce them.&nbsp; Hence in every age there has been a
higher appreciation of freedom, a quickened enterprise of enquiry, the
stream of legislation has refined and broadened in its flow, improvement
has extended its acreage of enclosure, and principles proved and gained
have become part of the property of the world.&nbsp; Our nature has had its
mental childhood.&nbsp; The established laws of mind admit only of a
gradual communication <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>of knowledge.&nbsp; It was necessary,
therefore, that men should be first stored with elementary principles, then
advanced to axioms and syllables, and afterwards introduced into the
fellowship of the mystery of Divine truth.&nbsp; Hence any reflective mind,
pondering upon the dealings of God with men, will discover a progressive
development of revelation, adjusted with careful adaptation to the
preparedness of different ages of mankind.&nbsp; In the first ages God
spake to men in sensible manifestations, in visions of the night, by
audible voice, in significant symbol.&nbsp; As time advanced the sensible
manifestations became rarer, and were reserved for great and distinguishing
occasions.&nbsp; From the lips of a lawgiver, in the seer&rsquo;s vision,
and in the prophet&rsquo;s burden of reproof or consolation, the Divine
spake, and the people heard and trembled.&nbsp; At length, in the fulness
of time, the appeal to the senses was altogether discarded; the age of
spirituality began, and in the completed revelation men read, as they shall
read for ever, the Divine will in the perfected and royal word.&nbsp; And
this progress, which appears through all creation as an inseparable
condition of the works of God, present in everything, from the formation of
a crystal to the establishment of an economy, is seen also in the
successive dispensations <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>under which man has been brought into
connection with heaven.&nbsp; You can trace through all dispensations the
essential unity of revealed religion.&nbsp; There have never been but two
covenants of God with man&mdash;the covenant of works and the covenant of
grace; never but two religions&mdash;the religion of innocence, and the
religion of mercy.&nbsp; Through all economies there run the same
invariable elements of truth.&nbsp; The first promise contains within
itself the germ of all subsequent revelation&mdash;the Abrahamic covenant,
the separation of Israel, all the rites and all the prophecies, are but the
unfoldings of its precious meaning.&nbsp; Sacrifice for the guilty,
mediation for the far-off and wandering, regeneration for the impure,
salvation through the merit of another; these are the inner life of the
words, &ldquo;the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gospel therefore was preached unto Abraham.&nbsp;
Moses felt the potent influence of &ldquo;the reproach of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; David describeth the blessedness of &ldquo;the man
unto whom God imputeth not iniquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of this salvation
the prophets enquired and searched diligently.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christ was the
one name of the world&rsquo;s constant memory, &ldquo;to Him gave all the
prophets witness,&rdquo; and from the obscurest to the clearest revelation
all testified in tones which it was <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>difficult to
misunderstand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither is there salvation in any other, for
there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be
saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; The patriarchal dispensation had no elaborate furniture
nor gorgeous ritualism.&nbsp; The father was the priest of the household,
and as often as the firstling bled upon the altar it typified the faith of
them all in a better sacrifice to come.&nbsp; Then came the Jewish
dispensation with its array of services and external splendour, with its
expressive symbolism and its magnificent temple; and then, rising into a
higher altitude, the fulness of time came, and Christianity&mdash;the
religion not of the sensuous but of the spiritual, not of the imagination
awed by scenes of grandeur nor bewildered by ceremonies of terror, but of
the intellect yielding to evidence, of the conscience smitten by truth, of
the heart taken captive by the omnipotence of love&mdash;appeared for the
worship of the world.&nbsp; Our Saviour, in his conversation with the
Samaritan woman, inaugurated, so to speak, the dispensation of the
spiritual, &ldquo;The hour cometh, and now is,&rdquo;&mdash;there is the
moment of instalment, when the great bell of time might have pealed at once
a requiem for the past and a welcome to the grander future, &ldquo;when the
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Requiring spiritual worship, it was natural
that God should have &ldquo;built up a spiritual house,&rdquo; wherein he
should dwell in statelier presence than in &ldquo;houses made with
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence there is now rising upon earth, its masonry
unfinished, but advancing day by day, a spiritual temple more magnificent
than the temple of Solomon, costlier than the temple of Herod.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Destroy this temple,&rdquo; said the Saviour to his wondering
listeners, &ldquo;and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will thou rear
it up in three days?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But He spake of the temple of His
body.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What, know ye not that <i>your</i> bodies are the
members of Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes! believers everywhere are stones in the
spiritual house, broken perhaps into conformity, or chiselled into beauty
by successive strokes of trial; and wherever they are, in the hut or in the
ancestral hall, in the climates of the snow or of the sun, whether society
hoot them or honour them, whether they wrap themselves in delicate
apparelling, or, in rugged homespun, toil all day for bread, they are parts
of the true temple which God esteems higher than cloistered crypt or
stately fane, and the top stone of which shall hereafter be brought on with
joy.</p>
<p>The second representation of a believer&rsquo;s character is
<i>holiness</i>, &ldquo;a <i>holy</i> priesthood.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the <!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Jewish
dispensation the word was understood to mean no more than an outward and
visible separation unto God; the priests in the temple and the vessels of
their ministry were said to be ceremonially &ldquo;holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
more is implied in the term as it occurs in the text and kindred passages
than a mere ritual and external sanctity.&nbsp; It consists in the
possession of that mind which was also in Christ Jesus, in the
reinstatement in us of that image of God which was lost by the disobedience
of the fall.&nbsp; You will remember numerous scriptures in which holiness,
regarded as the supreme devotion of the heart and service to God, is
brought out as at once a requirement and a characteristic of a
Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
conversation and godliness?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ye holy, for I am
holy,&rdquo; &ldquo;as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in
all manner of conversation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God hath not called us to
uncleanness but unto holiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Having these promises,
dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh
and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is
absolutely necessary that this grace should be cultivated if we would
either fulfil the mission of our priesthood or abide in the Divine presence
for ever.&nbsp; Holiness is requisite whether to see the <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Lord or to walk before
men unto all well-pleasing; and as living witnesses, transcripts of
<i>His</i> holiness, enabled by his grace to maintain purity of heart and
life, God has promised to establish those who put their trust in Him.&nbsp;
Some Christians have been deterred from the search after this blessing of
heaven by the mistakes of those who have endeavoured to expound it, or by
the hypocrisy of those who have assumed its profession that they might the
better sin.&nbsp; It is marvellous how many different views of it have at
times obtained currency in the world.&nbsp; By some it has been resolved
into a sort of refined Hinduism, a state in which the soul is
&ldquo;unearthed, entranced, beatified&rdquo; by devout contemplation into
a pietistic rapture; others have deemed that the best way to secure it was
a retirement from the vexing world, a recreant forsaking of the active
duties of life, as if it consisted in immunity from temptation rather than
in victory over it.&nbsp; Others have placed it in surpliced observance or
in monastic vow; an equivocal regard to patterns of things in the heavens
which common men mistake for idolatry.&nbsp; Others again, reversing the
old Pythagorean maxim, and wearing the image of God upon their ring, have
expressed it by unworthy familiarity, a continual adverting to the gifts of
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the
spirit, and the experience of the soul in the flippancy of ordinary
conversation, as did some of the fanatics of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; Others
have represented it as a perpetual austerity, an investiture of our family
circles with all the hues of the sepulchre, and a flinging upon the face of
society the frown of a rebuking fretfulness, which would make the good of
an archangel evil spoken of in this censorious world.&nbsp; But the
scriptural holiness which believers long for, and which the Church is to
spread through the land, is not a necessary adjunct of any or all of
these.&nbsp; It is not the acting of a part in a drama, but the
forth-putting of a character in life, the exhibition in harmonious action
of the humble love and filial fear with which men &ldquo;work out their
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A holy priesthood.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
remarkable of this spiritual priesthood that it descends in no particular
succession, nor limits its privileges to any exclusive genealogy.&nbsp; The
holiness which is at once its distinctiveness and its hallowing comprehends
and can sanctify all relations of life.&nbsp; Let the minister have it, and
the love of Christ, his supremest affection, will prompt his loathing of
sin and his pity for sinners; will fire his zeal and make his words burn,
and will often urge him to cast himself upon the mercy-seat that his
labours may <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>not be in vain.&nbsp; Let the merchant, or the manufacturer, or
the man of business have it, and it need neither bate his diligence nor
hold him back from riches; but it will smite down his avarice and restrain
his greed of gold; it will make him abhor the fraud that is gainful, and
eschew the speculation that is hazardous, and shrink from the falsehood
that is customary, and check the competition that is selfish; and it will
utterly destroy the deceptive hand-bill, and the cooked accounts, and the
fictitious capital, as well the enormous dishonesties as the little lies of
trade.&nbsp; Let this holiness actuate the parent, and in his strong and
gentle rule he will mould the hearts of his children heavenward, and train
them in the admonition of the Lord, until, a commanded household, comely in
their filial love, they shall reverence their Father who is in
heaven.&nbsp; Let the child be impressed with holiness, and he will have
higher motives to obedience than he can gather from the constraint of duty
or from the promptings of affection.&nbsp; Let the master be holy, and
while he upholds authority he will dispense blessing.&nbsp; Let the servant
be holy, and service will be rendered with cheerfulness, &ldquo;not with
eye-service as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the man be holy, and vigorous health and <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>lofty intellect
and swaying eloquence and quenchless zeal will all be offered to God.&nbsp;
Let the woman be holy, and patient prayer will linger round the cross, and
ardent hope will haunt the envied sepulchre, and pitying tenderness will
wail on the way to Calvary, and the deep heart-love will forget all selfish
solicitudes in the absorbing question, &ldquo;Where have they laid my
Lord?&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the world be holy! and the millennium has come, and
wrong ceases for ever, and the tabernacle of God is with men, and
earth&rsquo;s music rivals heaven&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Brethren, let us seek this
blessing for ourselves.&nbsp; There, at the foot of the Throne, let us
plead the promise, &ldquo;I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you
shall be clean.&rdquo;&nbsp; Imagination, intellect, memory, conscience,
will;&mdash;sanctify them all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then will we teach
transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto
Thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is done, surely it is done.&nbsp; The hands are upon
us now.&nbsp; We kneel for the diviner baptism, for the effectual and
blessed ordination.&nbsp; Listen, the word has spoken, &ldquo;Ye are an
holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&mdash;Certain blessings are presented to us in the text as the
heritage of this spiritual and consecrated Church.&nbsp; <i>Increase</i>
and <i>acceptance</i>.&nbsp; <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>The spiritual house is to be built up firm and
consolidated on the true foundation.&nbsp; The services of the holy
priesthood are to be &ldquo;acceptable to God through Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Take the first thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are built up a spiritual house, an
holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact of God&rsquo;s constant supervision
over his Church and care for its stability and extension is one that is
impressed with earnest repetition upon the pages of his word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that
shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken, but there the
glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and
streams.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall thou see and flow together, and
thine heart shall fear and be enlarged, because the abundance of the sea
shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall the mountain of the Lord&rsquo;s house
be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the
hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As I live,
saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an
ornament, and bind them on thee as a bride doeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; From these
passages, and many others breathing the <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>same spirit, we may
legitimately infer that it is the purpose of God that the kingdom of
Messiah shall be universal; that the Church shall increase in steady and
cumulative progression, and realize in herself all the &ldquo;glorious
things&rdquo; which by the holy prophets were &ldquo;spoken of the city of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in this matter God has not left himself without a
witness.&nbsp; The present existence of the Church, after it has
encountered and outlived all varieties of opposition, is in itself a proof
which even its enemies, if they were not stupid and indocile learners,
might ere this have discovered, that the eternal God is its refuge, and
that the Highest will establish it for ever.&nbsp; From its institution it
has had in the heart of every man a natural and inveterate enemy.&nbsp; The
world has uniformly opposed it, and it has been unable to repel that
opposition with weapons out of the world&rsquo;s armoury; for it is
forbidden to rely upon the strength of armies or upon the forces of
external power.&nbsp; Fanatics have entered into unholy combination.&nbsp;
Herod and Pilate have truced up a hollow friendship that they might work
against it together.&nbsp; Statesmen have elaborated their policy, and
empires have concentrated their strength; the banners of battle have made
hideous laughter with the wind; the blood of many sainted confessors has
been shed like water, <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>and the vultures of the crag have scented the
unburied witnesses and have been ready to swoop down upon the slain.&nbsp;
And yet the Church is living, thriving, multiplying; while the names of its
tyrants are forgotten, and their kingdoms, like snow-flakes on the wave,
have left no trace behind.&nbsp; No inborn strength will account for this
mystery.&nbsp; No advance of intelligence nor philosophic enlightenment
will explain this phenomenon.&nbsp; The acute observer, if faith have
cleared his eye or opened an inner one, will go back for the explanation to
an old and unforgotten promise, and will exclaim when he sees the Church
struggling, but triumphant, like the fire-girdled bush at Horeb, &ldquo;God
is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, and
that right early.&rdquo;&nbsp; And not only in the preservation from her
enemies but in her unfailing progress among men in every age, has God shown
that his purpose is to build up the spiritual house.&nbsp; The rapid spread
of the truth in primitive times was a marvel and a mystery to those who saw
not the arm which upheld it and the power which bade it multiply and
grow.&nbsp; The whole history of gospel extension is indeed a succession of
wonders.&nbsp; It began with a Pentecost, local, but prophetic of a
universal one, when &ldquo;its sound shall have gone <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>out into all the earth
and its words to the end of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the times of the
Apostles, and of their immediate successors, it overleaped the boundaries
of nation after nation, acquired lodgment and proselytes in the proudest
cities, subjugated the barbaric magnificence of Asia Minor, had its
students in the schools of Greece, and its servitors in the imperial
household at Rome.&nbsp; In its triumphant course it attacked idolatry in
its strongholds, and that idolatry, though fortified by habit and
prejudice, and sanctioned by classic learning, and entwined with the
beautiful in architecture and song, and venerable for its wondrous age, and
imperial in the dominion which it had exercised over a vassal world, fell
speedily, utterly, and for ever.&nbsp; And in each succeeding age, obscured
sometimes by the clouds of persecution, and sometimes by the mists of
error, its progress has been gradual and sure.&nbsp; If it has not
dissipated it has relieved the darkness.&nbsp; It has stamped itself upon
the institutions of mankind, and they reflect its image.&nbsp; It has
insinuated its leavening spirit where its outward expressions are not, and
there is a vast amount of Christian and humanizing sentiment abroad, a sort
of atmosphere breathed unconsciously by every man, whose air-waves break
upon society with unfelt but influencing pressure, <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>but its source is in
the gospel of Christ.&nbsp; The building rises still!&nbsp; In distant
parts of the great world-quarry stones of diverse hardness, and of diverse
hue, but all susceptible of being wrought upon by the heavenly masonry, are
every day being shaped for the temple.&nbsp; Strikes among the workmen, or
frost in the air, may suspend operations for awhile, but the building
rises!&nbsp; Often are the stones prepared in silence, as in the ancient
temple-pile, with no sound of the chisel or the hammer.&nbsp; The
Sanballats and Tobiahs of discouragement and shame may deride the work and
embarrass the labourers; but one by one the living stones, polished after
the similitude of a palace, are incorporated into it.&nbsp; Yes! the
building rises, and it shall rise for ever.&nbsp; God has promised increase
to the Church, and her enemies cannot gainsay it.&nbsp; From the more
effectual blessing on churches already formed, from the reversal of the
attainder, and the bringing into his patrimonial portion of the
disinherited Jew, from the proclamation in all lands of the message of
mercy, they shall throng into the city of our solemnities until &ldquo;the
waste and the desolate places, and the land of her destruction shall even
now be too many, by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee
up shall be far away.&rdquo;&nbsp; What Christian <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>heart, looking for this
promised blessing, rejoices not with exceeding joy?&nbsp; At the foundation
of the second temple, amid the flare of trumpets and the clang of cymbals,
while the young men rent the air with gladness, there were choking memories
in many a Levite heart that chastened the solemn joy and were relieved only
by passionate tears; but at the upbuilding of the &ldquo;spiritual
house&rdquo; the young and the old may feel an equal gladness, or if some
memories steal over the spirit of primitive days, and of the joys of a
forfeited Eden, they may be stilled by the memory of the grander and
abiding truth, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In Christ the tribes of Adam boast,<br />
More blessings than their father lost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brethren, have you this joy?&nbsp; Does it pleasure you that the
building rises?&nbsp; Do your hearts thrill with gladness as you hear of
accessions to the Church and the conversion of sinners to God?&nbsp; Do you
love the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob?&nbsp; Have a
care if you feel not this sympathy, for ye are none of his.&nbsp; If it is
within you a living, earnest emotion, give it play.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the
children of Zion be joyful in their King.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The second privilege is the acceptance of her service and sacrifice
through Jesus Christ</i>.&mdash;To us, <!-- page 27--><a

unworthy, it is no small privilege to be assured of welcome when we come to
God.&nbsp; To us, who are guilty and erring, it is no small privilege that
we can come by Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The hope of acceptance is necessary to
sustain the heart of the worshipper, which without it would soon sink into
despair.&nbsp; The apostle, you perceive, places the ground of the
acceptance of our services upon our union with Jesus Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Vain in themselves their duties were,<br />
&nbsp;  Their services could never please,<br />
Till join&rsquo;d with thine, and made to share<br />
&nbsp;  The merits of thy righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He is careful to impress upon us that in our holiest moments no less
than when we are wayward and criminal, our trust for personal safety, and
our only chance of blessing are from our exalted Daysman, who can lay his
hand upon us both.&nbsp; Our praise would be unmeaning minstrelsy, our
prayers a litany unheard and obsolete, all our devotional service a
bootless trouble, but that &ldquo;yonder the Intercessor stands and pours
his all-prevailing prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is &ldquo;through Him we
<i>both</i>,&rdquo; the Jews who crucified Him and the Gentiles, who by
their persevering neglect of Him crucify Him afresh, &ldquo;have access by
one spirit unto the Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words of promise touching the
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>acceptance of the worship of the Church are explicit and
numerous.&nbsp; &ldquo;They shall come up with acceptance on mine altar,
and I will glorify the house of my glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That I should
be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of
God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being
sanctified by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In the place where my
name is recorded, there will I accept.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In every nation
he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with
Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, comforting thought, when I am convinced of my own
sinfulness, and restless and disquieted wander about in distress, and lie
down in sorrow, there is One who hears the stammered entreaty, and smiles a
pardon to my agonized cry, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; When in my daily life I encounter a terrible
temptation, a temptation so strong that it tries my strength to the
uttermost, and gives my heart a struggle and a bitterness which no stranger
may know, there is One who marks my resistance and counts my enduring faith
for righteousness, and whispers me that by and bye, he that overcometh
shall wear the conqueror&rsquo;s crown.&nbsp; When in some moment of
unguardedness I grieve the good Spirit, and become unwatchful, and in
remorseful penitence I could almost weep my life away, the <!-- page
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>offering of my
contrition is accepted, and there is One who heals my backsliding and
soothes my fretting sorrow.&nbsp; My prayers offered in secret, pleading
for purity and blessing, my praises, when the full heart, attuned, gives
its note of blessing to swell the choral harmony, wherewith all God&rsquo;s
works praise Him, the active hand, the ready tongue, the foot swift and
willing in his cause, the service of labour, the service of
suffering,&mdash;all these, if I offer them rightly and reliantly, are
acceptable unto God by Jesus Christ.&nbsp; There is no room for distrust or
for misgiving.&nbsp; I need not fear that, after all my efforts, I shall be
met with an averted glance, or with a cold denial.&nbsp; The promise
standeth sure, &ldquo;To that man will I look.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, if there
had been a pause after this announcement, how would the eager solicitudes
of men have gathered round it, and waited for the coming of the
words.&nbsp; Where wilt thou direct thy look of favour?&nbsp; To him who is
noble, or wealthy, or intelligent?&nbsp; To him who with scrupulous
rigidness fasts twice in the week, and gives tithes of all that he
possesses?&nbsp; To him whose quick sensibility revels in all expressions
of the beautiful, or whose graceful impulse moves him in all works of
charity?&nbsp; No, to none of these, but, &ldquo;To him that is poor, and
of a contrite spirit; and that trembleth at my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>III.&mdash;If there be this assurance of acceptance, how solemn
and resistless is the call to duty, &ldquo;To offer up spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sacrifice, properly
speaking, is the infliction of death upon a living creature for the
purposes of religious worship, but <i>this</i> sacrifice and offering,
happily, God requires not at our hands.&nbsp; No filleted firstling need
now be led to the altar, the flocks of Kedar and the rams of Nebaioth may
browse quietly in their pastures, for the Great Sacrifice has been offered,
and it <i>abides</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>one sacrifice for sins for
ever</i>,&rdquo; needing no repetition, one for ever! unexhausted in its
virtue, and unfailing in the blessing it confers.&nbsp; But in a secondary
sense the recognized and fulfilled duties of the Church are fitly called
sacrifices, for they cannot be properly discharged without the alienation
from ourselves of something that was our own, and its presentation, whether
time, ease, property or influence, to God.&nbsp; Brethren, to this duty you
are called to-day.&nbsp; The name you bear has bound you.&nbsp; The holy
priesthood must offer up spiritual sacrifices.&nbsp; Suffered to become
Christians, permitted, a race adulterous and dishonoured as you were, to be
united to Christ and partakers of his precious grace, the spell of these
high privileges enforces every obligation, and hallows every claim.&nbsp;
<i>Ye</i> <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>are not your own.&nbsp; First offer yourselves upon the altar,
renew your covenant in this the house of our solemnities, on this the
instalment of our great Christian festival.&nbsp; It will be easy to devote
the accessories, when the principal bestowment has been rendered.&nbsp; I
claim from you this sacrifice for God.&nbsp; <i>Yourselves</i>, not a
half-hearted homage, not a divided service, not a stray emotion, not a
solitary faculty; <i>yourselves</i>, <i>you all</i>, and <i>all of you</i>;
your bodies, with their appliances for service; your souls, with their
ardour of affection; intellect, with its grasp and power; life, with its
activity and earnestness; endowment, with its manifold gifts; influence,
with its persuasive beseechings.&nbsp; I claim them all.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
beseech you therefore, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
service.&rdquo;&nbsp; This consecration made, all else will follow in the
train; litanies of earnest supplication will rise from the full heart; the
&ldquo;prayer will be offered as incense; the lifting up of the hands as
the evening <i>sacrifice</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Glad in its memory of the past,
and hopeful in its trust for the future, the hosanna of gratitude will
rise; &ldquo;the <i>sacrifice</i> of praise continually; the fruit of our
lips giving thanks to his name.&rdquo;&nbsp; The property received
gratefully from heaven will be offered freely and <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>bountifully for Christ;
and some outcast housed in a safe and friendly shelter, some emancipated
slave or converted Figian, some Indian breaking from his vassaldom of caste
and Shaster, and longing to sit at Jesus&rsquo; feet and hear his word,
will say rejoicingly of your liberality, &ldquo;Having received of
Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet
smell, a <i>sacrifice</i> acceptable, well-pleasing to God.&rdquo;</p>

33</span>CHRIST&rsquo;S WORK OF DESTRUCTION AND DELIVERANCE.<br />
REV. JOHN H. JAMES.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That through death He might destroy him that had the power of
death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were
all their lifetime subject to bondage.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Hebrews</span> ii. 14, 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a special and ordained connection between the incarnation and
the death of our blessed Lord.&nbsp; Other men die in due course after they
are born; he was born just that he might die.&nbsp; He came &ldquo;not to
be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give&rdquo; his &ldquo;life a
ransom for many.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is therefore evident that the theology
which magnifies the incarnation at the expense of the atonement is
fundamentally, fatally defective.&nbsp; The brotherhood of Christ with
every son of Adam is a blessed truth, but it is by no means the whole
truth, nor can it be practically available <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and influential apart
from the offering of his body upon the cross as a sacrifice for sin.&nbsp;
This is very clearly and strongly put in the text.&nbsp; The incarnation of
the Son of God is proved from the Old Testament, and shown to have had
reference to his redeeming death.&nbsp; Many purposes were answered by his
becoming partaker of flesh and blood.&nbsp; His influence as a teacher, the
power of his spotless example, his identification with the needs and
sorrows of humanity, and the deep sympathy resulting therefrom,&mdash;these
and similar ends were contemplated and fulfilled.&nbsp; But the grand
purpose was disclosed and accomplished on the cross, where God made his
soul an offering for sin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forasmuch then as the children are
partakers of flesh and blood, He also himself likewise took part of the
same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death,
that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all
their lifetime subject to bondage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The death of Jesus, then, and the end to be accomplished by it,
constitute the central, vital, culminating truth of Christianity.&nbsp; The
apostle puts the death of Christ in a striking point of view,&mdash;as a
work done, rather than a calamity suffered.&nbsp; And it was a double
work,&mdash;a work of destruction on the one hand, and of deliverance <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>on the
other,&mdash;of destruction in order to deliverance.&nbsp; That is the
conception of his mission embodied in the first promise.&nbsp; The bruising
of the serpent&rsquo;s head by the bruised heel of the Saviour, in order to
repair the ruin wrought by the tempter, suggests very significantly the
truth which is so explicitly announced here.&nbsp; And a similar
combination runs through the ancient providential history.&nbsp; The
destruction of the old world in order to the salvation of the righteous,
and the fulfilment of the promise of redemption; and the destruction of the
first-born of Egypt in order to the deliverance of Israel, are instances in
point.&nbsp; But the death of Christ upon the cross in order to the
emancipation of the slaves of Satan is the most glorious and perfect
illustration.&nbsp; Let me ask your attention to the work of Christ&rsquo;s
death,</p>
<p>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">As it is a Work of Destruction</span>.</p>
<p>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">As it is a Work of Deliverance</span>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">As it is a Work of
Destruction</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;That He might destroy him that had the
power of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Satan</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>is a person</i>, <i>and the enemy
of Jesus</i>, <i>who died to destroy him</i>.</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; The personality of the devil is necessarily implied in the
words of the text.&nbsp; The theory <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>which seeks to divest
all that is said about the devil in Scripture of everything like
personality, and to refine it away into figurative representation of
&ldquo;the principle of evil,&rdquo; is as unphilosophical as it is
unscriptural.&nbsp; How can we conceive of moral evil in the
abstract?&nbsp; How can we think of it apart from the depraved will of some
intelligent being?&nbsp; Whatever theories may be held respecting the
difficult question of the origin of evil, it is surely inconceivable that
it should exist independently of some living, conscious, intellectual
author.&nbsp; No truer or more philosophical solution can be found than
that of the Bible, which attributes it to the devil,&mdash;a being
originally good, who fell from his first estate, broke his allegiance to
the Creator, and so became the leader of a vast and fearful rebellion
against Almighty God.&nbsp; The case of man shows us the possibility of a
being existing in a holy but mutable state, and lapsing, under certain
inducements, into sin.&nbsp; What the inducements were in the instance of
the prince of darkness we are not told; and thus the question of the origin
of evil seems to be insoluble by us.&nbsp; But the identification of it
with the personal defection of Satan is far more intelligible and
reasonable than the attempt to treat it as a metaphysical
abstraction.&nbsp; All the representations of the Bible on <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the subject are
instinct with the awful personality of the devil.&nbsp; He is our
&ldquo;adversary;&rdquo; he is &ldquo;the accuser;&rdquo; he is &ldquo;the
God of this world;&rdquo; he is &ldquo;the prince of the power of the air,
that wicked one that now worketh in the hearts of the children of
disobedience;&rdquo; he that hath &ldquo;blinded the minds of them that
believe not;&rdquo; he &ldquo;leadeth&rdquo; sinners &ldquo;captive at his
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely that is a bold and unscrupulous theology which
resolves all these clear and strong expressions into the mere ideal
impersonation of a principle.&nbsp; O no!&nbsp; Satan is a being of subtle
intelligence, with a depraved, unconquerable, malignant will; a dread
living power, with whom we have continually to do, who &ldquo;desireth to
have us, that he may sift us as wheat,&rdquo; and with whom, if we wish to
get to heaven, we must be prepared to fight at every step of our way.</p>
<p>(ii.)&nbsp; And he is emphatically the enemy of Jesus, who came to
&ldquo;destroy&rdquo; him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will put enmity between thee and
the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in
pursuit of his designs against the living God that Satan persuaded our
first parents to commit sin; it was by lying insinuations against God that
he deceived her who was &ldquo;first in the transgression.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
course, he is the enemy of man.&nbsp; Of course, his design is to inflict
ruin and misery on men, <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and to bring them to his own state and place of
torment.&nbsp; But he does this by seducing them into rebellion against the
Most High.&nbsp; Hatred of God is the spring of all his conduct, the motive
of every enterprise which he undertakes.&nbsp; And Jesus, the Son of God,
the vindicator of the divine honour, is necessarily the sworn eternal foe
of the devil; and He has come into our world as into the arena of a supreme
conflict for the defeat and overthrow of Satan; has assumed the very nature
which the foul fiend seduced and degraded, in order that, in that same
nature, he might avenge the wrong done to the being and government of God,
and put an eternal end to the usurpation and tyranny of his enemy.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>The devil</i> &ldquo;<i>had the power of
death</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; We must not understand this as meaning that Satan has direct,
independent, and absolute control over death, inflicting it how, and when,
and where, and on whom, he will.&nbsp; The later Jewish writers taught the
horrible doctrine that the fallen angels have power or authority generally
in reference to life and death.&nbsp; But this never was the case.&nbsp;
Death was the sentence pronounced by God upon man, and it could only be
inflicted by his appointment and concurrence.&nbsp; The power of life and
death is necessarily in God&rsquo;s hands, and his only.</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>(ii.)&nbsp; But Satan had the power of death, in this sense;
namely, that he tempted man to commit the sin which &ldquo;brought death
into the world, and all our woe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He enticed Eve to sin, partly
by denying that her offence would be visited with the punishment of
death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye shall not surely die,&rdquo; was the lie by which he
contradicted and defied the God of truth, and induced the woman &ldquo;to
eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so, he was &ldquo;a murderer from the
beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God made man to be immortal, an image of his
own eternity; nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this sense, then, as the author and introducer of
that sin whose &ldquo;wages&rdquo; is death, Satan &ldquo;had the power of
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(iii.)&nbsp; Moreover, it is the work of Satan to invest death with its
chief terrors.&nbsp; We shrink indeed from the humiliating prospect of
corruption and decay; we cling fondly to those companionships,
associations, and pleasures, from which death for ever separates us; we
deprecate and dread the blighting of our earthly hopes, and the ruthless
frustration of our schemes.&nbsp; These are very painful accessories of
death; but they are not its sting; they do not make it a poison for the
soul as well as for the body.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>sting of death is
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; That sting has been drawn for the Christian, and death
hath no terrors for him.&nbsp; But, had the power of the devil in death
been unassailed and uncounteracted, the dissolution of the body and the
eternal ruin of the soul would have been alike complete and
irrecoverable.&nbsp; By the consciousness of guilt, Satan has infused an
element of insupportable terror into death.&nbsp; For it is that
consciousness which makes death dreadful.&nbsp; It is quite probable that,
if man had not sinned, his body would have undergone some great change,
that it might be fitted for that &ldquo;kingdom of God,&rdquo; which
&ldquo;flesh and blood cannot inherit;&rdquo; but such change would have
inflicted no pain, and involved no humiliation; it would only have been a
change &ldquo;from glory to glory;&rdquo; and would have been anticipated
with no sentiments contrary to desire and hope.&nbsp; But death, besides
its own inherent ghastliness, is rendered dreadful through the malice of
the devil, and the guilty fear of the penal hereafter which haunts all
those who are in his power.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Jesus died to destroy</i> &ldquo;<i>him that had the power
of death</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has indeed provisionally destroyed death
itself for all &ldquo;the sons of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Death, the last
enemy, shall be destroyed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is not absolutely and
immediately abolished.&nbsp; The <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>death of the body remains, even for God&rsquo;s
people, as a sad and humiliating monument of the evil of sin; but to them
it is not now a punishment, but the mode of their birth into a new and more
glorious life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mortals cry, &lsquo;A man is dead!&rsquo;<br />
Angels sing, &lsquo;A child is born!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be truly said of the hour when a good man dies, that it is the
hour when he enters into life.&nbsp; And this is because Jesus destroyed
&ldquo;him that had the power of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not annihilate
him, the word does not mean that, but He neutralized, counteracted,
stripped him of his power.&nbsp; The whole design and effect of death, when
in the power of the devil, has been defeated and reversed by the death of
Christ.&nbsp; Though the bodies of his people be consigned to the grave, it
is in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to everlasting life.&nbsp;
That melancholy seed-time in which we cast the dust of our beloved into the
earth, is the prelude to a glorious harvest; that when &ldquo;He giveth his
beloved sleep,&rdquo; is preparatory to their awaking to glory and
immortality.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is sown in corruption, it is raised in
incorruption; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown in
dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>spiritual body.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is what Christ&rsquo;s death has
done for the bodies of his people; and is it not an entire breaking of the
power of the devil over death?&nbsp; As to their souls, death delivers them
from the burden of the flesh, that they may be in joy and felicity with
God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Absent from the body,&rdquo; they are for ever
&ldquo;present with the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Death is no longer a dark and
dreadful phantom, rising from the abyss, to drag down his victims and gorge
himself upon them.&nbsp; He is an angel, pure and bright, sent to summon
God&rsquo;s beloved to their Father&rsquo;s house above.&nbsp; That which
men naturally dread as the crown and climax of all evils, becomes an object
of wistful longing, for God&rsquo;s servants have &ldquo;a desire to depart
and be with Christ, which is far better.&rdquo;&nbsp; This stripping away
of Satan&rsquo;s power, this destruction of &ldquo;him that had the power
of death,&rdquo; is due to the death of Jesus.&nbsp; He thus redeemed us
from the debt of death, &ldquo;acknowledging the debt in the manner in
which he removed it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Christ, by giving himself up to
death, has acknowledged the guilt, and truly atoned for it; He has, in one
act, atoned for the sinner and judged the sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; By dying for
sins, He expiated that which gives to death its &ldquo;sting,&rdquo; its
power to injure and to terrify.&nbsp; He</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Entered the grave in mortal flesh,<br />
And dwelt among the dead,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>that He might put an end to Satan&rsquo;s power in and over
death.&nbsp; Some sound and excellent divines are of opinion that, in the
interval between his death and resurrection He literally &ldquo;descended
into hell,&rdquo; and there, in personal conflict, grappled with and
overthrew the devil.&nbsp; However this may be, it is certain that the
bruising of his heel by Satan was the chosen means for his bruising of
Satan&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Our enemy, who brought death into the world, is
entirely baffled and defeated, as to the purpose and effect of that
calamity, in the case of all who believe in the death of Christ.&nbsp;
Their last act of faith gives them &ldquo;the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the God of peace &ldquo;finally beats down
Satan under their feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Death is &ldquo;swallowed up of
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; What power over death has the devil in such a
case?&nbsp; Is it not wholly counteracted?&nbsp; Is not death a wholly
different, nay, opposite thing to what he intended, when by tempting and
conquering our first parents he brought it into the world?&nbsp; The body
of the good man &ldquo;is buried in peace, and his soul is blessed for
evermore.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shall never more, through the long eternity of
bliss, be assailed or injured by &ldquo;him that had the power of
death:&rdquo; nor shall he see his enemy again, unless it be to triumph
openly over him, in that day when <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>&ldquo;death, and hell shall be cast into the
lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many good people
are unduly afraid of the devil, and especially they are in dread of his
possible power in their last moments.&nbsp; But we may dismiss this fear as
altogether needless and unworthy.&nbsp; Christ has not only rendered our
great enemy utterly powerless for evil, but has, by his own most precious
death, compelled even Satan into the service of the sons of God.&nbsp; He
has turned the supreme calamity brought into the world by the arch-fiend
into the supreme glory and joy of all who believe in himself.&nbsp; To all
those who are by Jesus&rsquo; death &ldquo;to life restored,&rdquo; the day
of death is infinitely preferable to the day of birth, for then beginneth
that new life which shall never die.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know whom I have
believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have
committed unto Him until that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Let us now contemplate the work of Jesus,
in his death</span>, <span class="smcap">as a work of
deliverance</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;And deliver them who, through fear of
death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we
ascertain the import of this description of those whom Christ died to
deliver, we shall easily understand the nature and mode of the deliverance
wrought out for them.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>They were in bondage</i>.&nbsp; They were in fact <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>enslaved by
&ldquo;him who had the power of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a very fearful
view of our natural state, and one which contradicts all the conclusions of
our own vanity and self-complacency.&nbsp; Unconverted men believe that
Christians are slaves, fettered by doubts, scruples, self-accusations;
bound in the bands of moral routine, and able only to move in certain
prescribed grooves; afraid to do as they list.&nbsp; According to their
notion, true liberty consists in throwing off religious restraints, and
following as much as may be &ldquo;the devices and desires of our own
hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this is a terrible delusion, which only serves to
show the depth and subtlety of him who, besides having &ldquo;the power of
death,&rdquo; is also &ldquo;the father of lies,&rdquo; the great deceiver
and ensnarer of mankind.&nbsp; History is full of analogous examples among
men.&nbsp; In how many instances have the most cruel and remorseless
tyrants made use of the passions and brute force of the multitude to secure
their own elevation to absolute power, inducing their victims to forge and
rivet their own chains.&nbsp; And it is so in this case.&nbsp; Sinners are
the slaves of Satan; those evil desires and inclinations which they so
recklessly obey are but the tools and bonds of the great oppressor.&nbsp;
The wicked man sells his soul to the devil for the price of indulgence in
&ldquo;the pleasures <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>of sin, which are but for a
season.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a very easy way of testing this question of
freedom or bondage in sin.&nbsp; If you are really free, free to do as you
like, you can do good as well as evil; you can give up your companionship
with iniquity, and break your covenant with darkness, as readily, and with
as little difficulty, as you made the compact.&nbsp; Let the man who
rejoices in his liberty to sin try to abandon iniquity; he will surely find
it an impossible task.&nbsp; However clearly he may discern the purity,
justice, and goodness of God&rsquo;s law, however passionately he may long,
and however earnestly he may strive, to regulate his life by it, he will
find himself &ldquo;carnal, sold under sin;&rdquo; he will &ldquo;find
another law in his members warring against the law of his mind, and
bringing him into captivity to the law of sin and death.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
easy to float with the stream, and the stronger the current the more
buoyantly and exultingly it bears you on.&nbsp; But try to breast the
current.&nbsp; You will soon find that you have undertaken a task which is
&ldquo;impossible with men,&rdquo; and will sink exhausted and undone with
the vain endeavour.&nbsp; Alas! Satan is in very truth the lord of every
enslaved soul, not rightfully, only by virtue of the foulest usurpation;
but he is so in fact, and he &ldquo;binds our captive souls fast in his
slavish chains.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>And by this bondage unto sin he holds us
captive to death.&nbsp; His law is &ldquo;the law of sin and death;&rdquo;
and till Christ redeem and actually deliver us, we are bound over to endure
&ldquo;the bitter pains of eternal death.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is an awful
thought, but it is as true as it is awful.&nbsp; Our cruel and relentless
jailer keeps us in the prison of sin, shut up under his power, with a view
to our everlasting death.&nbsp; May we be made conscious of our
enslavement, for till we become so, we are not likely to seek for
deliverance!</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>The sure sign of bondage to Satan is continual
subjection</i>, <i>or rather liability</i>, <i>to the fear of
death</i>.&nbsp; It would scarcely be true to say of the great mass of the
unconverted, that they are continually haunted and incommoded by the fear
of death.&nbsp; Their general condition is one of thoughtless and careless
ease, but they are always, even through their whole life, liable to be thus
haunted and incommoded.&nbsp; Whenever the thought of death is brought home
to them, as in the course of events it is ever and again sure to be, they
are appalled and terrified.&nbsp; They then feel that death has a sting,
and they have some foretaste of its sharpness and venom.&nbsp; They see
nothing in death but the ruin of all their earthly hopes and schemes, and
nothing after death but &ldquo;a certain fearful looking for of judgment
and fiery <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>indignation which shall devour the adversaries,&rdquo; and when
they seem to be themselves stricken by the hand of death, how do the
terrors of hell make them afraid!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;O death, how shocking must thy summons be,<br />
To him that is at ease in his possessions!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a difference however, and a very great one, between the fear of
death and the fear of dying.&nbsp; Many good people are often tormented by
the latter kind of fear.&nbsp; It is frequently the result of a sensitive
organization, or ill health, or a naturally gloomy temperament; and many
who have been much troubled by it through life have found it to vanish
completely when the supreme moment came.&nbsp; But the fear of death is
founded on the consciousness of unpreparedness for it, and on the
anticipation of the punishments which it will bring.&nbsp; Every unsaved
sinner has abundant reason for the fear which, however he may laugh it off,
will assuredly at times gain the mastery over him.&nbsp; The brooding sense
of insecurity; the secret sudden pang, stabbing him in the midst of his
wildest joys; the desperate effort never to think, and the resolute refusal
ever to speak of death; tell their tale, and show that the slaves of Satan
are always liable to the fear of death.&nbsp; O, if this be your case, it
is high <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>time to look to yourselves!&nbsp; If you cannot bear the thought
of death; if the great and solemn hereafter is haunted by images that scare
and threaten you; if you &ldquo;put far away the evil day;&rdquo; be sure
there is something radically wrong.&nbsp; Be sure, by that token, that you
are the slave of the devil.&nbsp; Be sure that you &ldquo;are in jeopardy
every hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never rest, never for a moment be satisfied, till
you can look death calmly in the face, and discern for yourself the life to
come, and your inheritance in heaven.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>For we all may have deliverance from our bondage to
Satan</i>, <i>and from this characteristic effect and sign of it</i>.&nbsp;
The death of Jesus has provided this deliverance for us.&nbsp; By depriving
Satan of his power over death, by expiating that sin which is the sting of
death, and so entirely reversing and counteracting its penal efficacy,
Christ hath wrought out for us a great salvation.&nbsp; And when we commit
ourselves to Him, relying on the efficacy of his atonement, our chains are
broken, and our craven fears are banished.&nbsp; Among the &ldquo;first
words&rdquo; of newly-converted souls none are more common or triumphant
than these, &ldquo;I am not afraid to die now!&nbsp; I have a hope beyond
the grave!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is indeed a mighty deliverance.&nbsp; What calm,
what security, what blessed hope does it inspire!&nbsp; To lose all <!--
page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>fear of
the last and greatest of human calamities; to look into the face of that
which was &ldquo;once an uncouth hideous thing,&rdquo; and to find that
through our Saviour&rsquo;s death it hath become &ldquo;most fair and full
of grace;&rdquo; to see no longer a dark and shrouded fiend arrayed in
mortal terrors, and poising an envenomed dart for the purpose of laying us
low, and compassing our lasting ruin; but a shining and smiling messenger
from the King of kings, bidding us to an everlasting banquet in his royal
palace; is not this true, priceless, boundless liberty,&mdash;worth
toiling, striving, suffering, dying for?&nbsp; This flower of immortal hope
blooms for each of us at the foot of the cross.&nbsp; If by the death of
Jesus we gain spiritual life, we shall rejoice in hope of the glory of God,
and shall look forward to the day of our death as the day of our eternal
marriage with the King of glory.&nbsp; Let us not lose this unspeakable
privilege!&nbsp; Let us, by faith in the death of our Lord, secure our
freedom and our birthright!&nbsp; And, as we think of our smitten friends,
let us thank God for their final deliverance from the power of death, and
their admission into everlasting life.&nbsp; Finally, let us more and more
glory in that cross whereby our Saviour Christ &ldquo;hath abolished death,
and hath brought life and immortality to light.&rdquo;</p>

51</span>INCONSIDERATION DEPLORED.<br />
REV. JOSHUA PRIESTLEY.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their
wickedness.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hosea</span> vii. 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible for any man to conceive of truths more fitted to arrest
the attention and impress the heart than are those contained in this
volume?&nbsp; It has been said that if a blank book had been put into our
hands, and every one of us had been asked to put into it the promises we
should like to find there, we could not have employed language so explicit,
so expressive, and so suited to all our varied wants, as is here.&nbsp; And
may I not say that no facts and declarations and appeals could be more
fitted to rouse the conscience, and to regulate the life, than those we
here find.&nbsp; Alas! however, with what affecting appropriateness may the
Almighty say of Englishmen as of Israelites&mdash;of persons living
eighteen <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>centuries after Christ&rsquo;s death, as of those living eight
centuries before it&mdash;&ldquo;They consider not in their hearts that I
remember all their wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This passage brings before us two parties.&nbsp; One is the speaker, the
other the persons addressed.&nbsp; It states a fact respecting each.&nbsp;
Let us look at these facts:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; says Jehovah, &ldquo;all their
wickedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; What an idea does this statement furnish of the
unlimited vastness of the Divine mind!&nbsp; For if He remembered all the
evil deeds of all the Israelites, He remembered the evil deeds of all other
persons.&nbsp; If He remembered all the evil deeds of all then living, He
remembered all the evil deeds of all who ever had lived.&nbsp; And if He
remembered all evil deeds, assuredly He remembered all good ones.&nbsp; The
Scriptures declare this fact for the comfort of the righteous.&nbsp; What a
cheering declaration to a good man is that found in Hebrews vi. 10,
&ldquo;For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love,
which ye have showed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the
saints, and do minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a vast number of incidents are
included in the space of but one year in the history of each one of
us!&nbsp; What a still vaster number in the whole period of life!&nbsp; And
when we think of the ten hundred millions of mankind <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>now peopling our globe;
when we add to these the almost countless millions that have departed, and
realize the fact that every incident of every individual of them is
remembered&mdash;remembered as distinctly too as if one solitary incident
were all that memory was charged with, what an idea is given us of the
vastness of the Divine mind!&nbsp; What can we do but wonder and adore!</p>
<p>My text says much, but like many others, it means more than it
says.&nbsp; How much of what Scripture intends to teach us shall we fail to
learn, if we do not consider what is included and involved, as well as what
is affirmed!&nbsp; This declaration imports three things.&nbsp; It
imports&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That God observes all our wickedness.&nbsp; To remember a thing
implies knowledge of it.&nbsp; This knowledge the Scriptures frequently
declare the Divine Being to possess.&nbsp; They tell us that His eyes run
to and fro the earth, beholding the evil and the good; that all things are
naked and open to His eyes.&nbsp; They go further.&nbsp; They teach us that
He is always present with us all, that there is no part of this earth, of
the vast universe, from which He is ever absent.&nbsp; David expresses
himself strikingly on this point&mdash;&ldquo;Whither shall I go from Thy
spirit?&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;or wither shall I flee from Thy
presence?&nbsp; If I <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>ascend up into heaven, Thou art there: if I
make my bed in hell (hades), behold, Thou art there.&nbsp; If I take the
wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even
there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.&nbsp; If I
say, surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light
about me.&nbsp; Yea, the darkness hideth not from Thee; but the night
shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to
Thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psalm cxxxix. 7&ndash;12.&nbsp; How certainly therefore
does God observe all our wickedness!&nbsp; Did we but constantly realize
this fact what a restraining power it would exert over us when we are
tempted to evil.&nbsp; A man left his cottage very early one morning taking
with him a sack, and accompanied by his son, a little boy.&nbsp; That boy
was a Sunday scholar, and little suspected his father&rsquo;s errand.&nbsp;
After proceeding some distance the father entered a turnip field, and
throwing down his sack, looked in this direction and in that to see whether
any one was observing him.&nbsp; On discovering the father&rsquo;s object,
the child said, &ldquo;Father, there was one way you did not
look.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied he, hastily; &ldquo;which
was that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You did not look upward,&rdquo; was the
rejoinder, &ldquo;and God is observing you.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was a word in
season.&nbsp; The father&rsquo;s <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>arm was paralyzed.&nbsp; He took up his sack
and returned home.&nbsp; Remember, my friends, that the sleepless eye of
the Omnipresent One is upon you.&nbsp; The man that goes forth at the
still, dark, hour of midnight to plunder our habitations, how startled
would he be if an inmate should noiselessly and suddenly present himself
before him&mdash;the servant that robs his master, the circulator of base
coin, the man of fraud&mdash;would these practise their misdeeds if they
realized this truth: &ldquo;Thou God seest me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Would the
slanderer, or backbiter, or hypocrite, indulge their habits if they
realized this truth?&nbsp; Of what immense benefit would the realization of
this truth be, both personally and socially!</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When God says that He remembers all our wickedness, He means us
to understand that He will exhibit it all.&nbsp; Why did He tell this
people that He remembered all their wickedness?&nbsp; The Scriptures answer
that question.&nbsp; They inform us that He intends to make use of the
stores of which memory is possessed, and that He intends to make this use
of them&mdash;to hold them up to the gaze of the universe.&nbsp; They teach
us that the conduct of every individual will be investigated and
published.&nbsp; &ldquo;For God shall bring every work into judgment, with
every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Every idle <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>word that men shall speak, they shall give
account thereof in the day of judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Important purposes
will he answered by this.&nbsp; A declaration will be made of the
righteousness of God in condemning the ungodly.&nbsp; He will hold up to
view the nature and extent of the requirements He made of us, their
reasonableness and beneficialness we shall all acknowledge.&nbsp; He will
then make known the innumerable acts of goodness He bestowed&mdash;His
forbearance to inflict punishment, and the various methods He employed to
bring us to repentance.&nbsp; And by the side of all this He will exhibit
our conduct toward Him&mdash;our ingratitude, our disobedience, our
perverseness.&nbsp; And with what enormity will these things then appear
invested!&nbsp; So guilty will thy conduct then appear, O sinner, that thou
wilt be constrained to exclaim: &ldquo;Thou art righteous, O Lord, which
art, and wast, and shall be, because Thou hast judged thus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What an exhibition will he made on that day!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When God says that He remembers all our wickedness, He means us
to understand that He will punish for it all, if it be not repented
of.&nbsp; The maintenance of law and order in the universe require the
Divine Being to display His abhorrence of transgression.&nbsp; And how can
that abhorrence be suitably displayed otherwise than <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>by punishment?&nbsp;
And the punishment must be of a degree to represent the guiltiness of the
conduct.&nbsp; It must be impartial, and be inflicted therefore on every
transgressor.&nbsp; The rich man cannot buy exemption from it.&nbsp; The
man of mighty intellect, or powerful eloquence, cannot persuade himself,
not to say the righteous Judge, into the belief that he ought to be
exempt.&nbsp; The man of good desires and pious resolutions, he who was
born of praying parents, and often bowed his knees at the footstool of his
Maker, but delayed to surrender his heart, cannot escape.&nbsp; No, my
friends, the decree of the Almighty has gone forth, it is
irreversible&mdash;there is none more righteous, and none that will more
certainly be fulfilled: &ldquo;Though hand join in hand the wicked shall
not be unpunished.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The wicked shall be driven away in
his wickedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The wicked shall be turned into
hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a mercy that we are not receiving our merited
punishment at this moment!&nbsp; And why are we not?&nbsp; Because the God
whom we have so shamefully and inexcusably resisted and provoked &ldquo;is
long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Opportunity is afforded for
repentance.&nbsp; He employs means to bring us to repentance.&nbsp; How
good, how loving, God is!&nbsp; &ldquo;God is love.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Can any of you still resist the strivings of his Spirit?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ has died that you might live, live with Him in His kingdom of
glory for ever.&nbsp; He shed for you His precious blood.&nbsp; For you He
now intercedes at the right hand of the Majesty on high.&nbsp; And if you
come to Him, however guilty you are, truly sorry for your sins, and believe
His own gracious declaration, that He came into the world to save sinners,
to seek and to save that which was lost, He will pardon and bless
you.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
the truth is not in us.&nbsp; If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God remembers all our wickedness.&nbsp; How much of it do you
remember?&nbsp; How little of it do any of us remember!&nbsp; The past is
to a large extent a vague and dim expanse.&nbsp; Many of you have climbed
these noble hills, and as you stood on the summit, you observed that
distinct as were the objects near, those remote were quite
indistinct.&nbsp; It is but a few conspicuous objects you can discern at
any considerable distance.&nbsp; Just so it is in reviewing our past
lives.&nbsp; We can call to mind a few things.&nbsp; We can remember
well&mdash;ah, we cannot forget, we have often wished <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>we could, an act of
rebellion against our parents of which we were once guilty; of obstinacy
toward a master; of ingratitude toward a benefactor; of dishonourableness
toward a friend, or unkindness toward a neighbour.&nbsp; There are several
sad deeds in the life of every one of us which we cannot forget, but how
many which we have all forgot.&nbsp; The things we can remember are as the
milestones to the weary traveller, far, far apart.&nbsp; Yes, we forget,
but God does not.&nbsp; He remembers them all.&nbsp; There is not a single
improper word we have ever uttered, not a wrong feeling we have cherished,
not an ungodly deed we have done, not a duty we have neglected, but God
knew it, will exhibit it, and if unrepented of, will punish for it.&nbsp;
Hear it, ponder it, hide it in the depths of your heart, God remembers all
our wickedness.</p>
<p>Having considered the import of the declaration as it regards Almighty
God, we come now to consider&mdash;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The charge against the Israelites.&nbsp; They are not charged,
you observe, with denying the truth the Divine Being affirms respecting
Himself, or even with doubting it.&nbsp; They admitted it, believed it, but
it was unpalatable to them, and therefore they put it away from their
thoughts.&nbsp; What a melancholy exhibition of character was <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>this!&nbsp; And
yet does not this declaration hold true of greatly more than one-half of
the population of this evangelized land?&nbsp; Does it not hold true of
every <i>drunkard</i>?&nbsp; Could he spend his hard-earned money in that
which stupifies his mind, injures his body, degrades his character,
shortens his life, and destroys his soul; and besides all this, brings want
and wretchedness on his family, and makes himself a scandal and reproach to
humanity&mdash;could any man yield himself to the power of intoxicating
liquor that considered what is involved in such a course?</p>
<p>Does not this charge hold true of every <i>sensualist</i>?&nbsp; Could
any man become the victim of degrading passions, could he consent to
sacrifice the mental and moral part of his nature&mdash;the man to the
animal&mdash;if he considered what was due to himself, to society, and to
God?</p>
<p>Does not the charge hold true of the <i>pleasure hunter</i>?&nbsp; As a
condiment, as a relaxation, pleasure seeking, if of the right sort, is not
only allowable but commendable.&nbsp; He who gave life intended it to be a
joy.&nbsp; To be always seeking after pleasure, however, exercises a
dissipating and debilitating influence on the mind, and prevents the
acquirement of true nobleness and worth of character.&nbsp; And would a
creature, which is the highest workmanship of Infinite Excellence with
which we are <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>acquainted, yield himself to this, if given to the consideration
of the fact the Almighty here states respecting himself?</p>
<p>To mention but one other class of character, does not the charge hold
true of <i>the fraudulent</i>?&nbsp; Would a man rob his soul to enrich his
pocket, would he narrow his heart to expand his purse, would he build up a
character that is to endure for ever with such ill-tempered mortar as
falsehood; would he be willing to encounter all the piercing looks and
accusing words with which those he wronged will one day assail him, if he
had taken his relationship to God, and man, and eternity, into
consideration?</p>
<p>What incalculable mischief and misery this neglect of consideration has
wrought in our world!&nbsp; Had our first parents considered the sad
consequences that would ensue to themselves and their posterity, would they
have plucked the forbidden fruit?&nbsp; Through what a long and mournful
list of events that have happened from that day to this might I easily go,
all of which would have been avoided if right consideration had been
given!&nbsp; Every day during those six thousand years a multitude of such
events have happened.&nbsp; Is there one of you but can recal deeds
respecting which you say with bitterness of heart, I wish I had given it
consideration&mdash;I wish I had considered it more fully?</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>My
young friends permit me to urge consideration upon you.&nbsp; Your welfare
for both worlds is largely in your own keeping.&nbsp; You can secure it or
destroy it.&nbsp; But to secure it, consideration is essential.&nbsp; If
you don&rsquo;t addict yourselves to reflection you will be largely at the
mercy of impulse, be enticed probably by evil companions, and get wrong
perhaps in a thousand ways.&nbsp; Reluctant as you may feel at first to
engage in it&mdash;uninteresting as you may deem it, do not, as rational
creatures, prefer the pleasing to the right and good.&nbsp; The young man
of reflection is more respected, more valuable, and unspeakably more happy,
than the frivolous and vain.&nbsp; If you forget all else I say, do not
forget this&mdash;it is the declaration of your loving Father in heaven,
who wishes to welcome you there, but can welcome those only who yield to
Him a filial love&mdash;&ldquo;I remember all their wickedness.&rdquo;</p>

63</span>THE FRIEND WHOSE YEARS DO NOT FAIL.<br />
REV. W. ARTHUR, M.A.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And thy years shall not fail.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Hebrews</span> i. 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know that these words are taken from the hundred and second
Psalm.&nbsp; There, they are addressed to God the Creator; here, to Christ
the Redeemer.&nbsp; In both cases they express the same truths.&nbsp; Man
finds himself here, looks out to what he can see around him, and then in
thought passes on to what he cannot see.&nbsp; He knows that a very little
while ago he was not here, he was not anywhere.&nbsp; He has an instinct
within which tells him that though it is so short a time since he was not
the time will never come when he will not be&mdash;an instinct that cries
for a permanent foundation.&nbsp; He is not such foundation
himself&mdash;he feels that.&nbsp; He stands upon the foundation of the
earth: he did not lay it; it did not lay itself.&nbsp; Those layers of rock
were not their own framers.&nbsp; But the foundation <i>was</i> laid.&nbsp;
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of
the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is under a covering as well as on a foundation.&nbsp; He did not
pitch that canopy, nor fix those lights, nor hang those curtains by whose
silent closing and withdrawing the light is heightened or dimmed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The heavens are the work of thy hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; But will these
last?&nbsp; Will this earth that I stand upon last?&nbsp; No; I see on it
the marks of age and decay as on myself.&nbsp; Like me it will
perish.&nbsp; And those heavens that are over me, they shall
perish&mdash;will all things perish?&nbsp; Will everything that is go out
of being?&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou remainest.&rdquo;&nbsp; They shall wax old, it
is true, but that is only as if a garment waxed old; &ldquo;As a vesture
shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this
that the eye can see above, below, around, is to the great King but as the
robe upon the Sovereign to his person, and dominion, and when he folds up
that vesture and lays it aside he will command another wherewith to show
his glory to his subjects.&nbsp; &ldquo;They shall perish; but thou
remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as a vesture
shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same,
and thy years shall not fail!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>We
have here a preacher, a listener, a subject: changeful nature, mortal man,
immutable Godhead.</p>
<p>Changeful nature is a perpetual preacher, evermore proclaiming to us the
twofold lesson, our own mortality and God&rsquo;s immutable glory and
power.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy years shall not fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; What strange
language applied to the Divine Being&mdash;perfectly natural as applied to
us&mdash;&ldquo;years!&rdquo;&nbsp; Our life is finite, our life is
measured, our life is dealt out to us in parcels.&nbsp; For us to speak of
our &ldquo;years&rdquo; is natural, but when we look up to Him that is
unmeasured, infinite, eternal, then this word &ldquo;years&rdquo; becomes
but the representative of our small transient life when trying to contrast
itself with his broad and Infinite Being.&nbsp; We are constantly speaking
of two things wherewith we find ourselves related&mdash;space and time: and
what are they?&nbsp; We hardly know.&nbsp; We know but something like this:
space is a measured distance in infinity; time a measured duration in
eternity.</p>
<p>We are launched in the midst of a sea of eternity, and all the time that
comes to us comes by solemn public measurement, measurement conducted in
the most formal and stately manner by the hand of the Creator.&nbsp; He
made that heaven from which we can never shut <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>our regard&mdash;we
must see it; and in it He set those lights &ldquo;for signs and for seasons
and for days and for years.&rdquo;&nbsp; He might easily have given us a
being that would have flowed on evenly from its beginning to its close
without anything to mark it off into stages.&nbsp; We may almost watch a
sunbeam starting from the sun and racing all the way to our world, passing
over it, far on beyond it, till our eye and even our thought cannot follow
it, and never anything to check or register its progress.</p>
<p>But not so the career that God has appointed to us.&nbsp; Everything is
dealt to us under an economy of measure, of trust and of account.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For signs&rdquo;&mdash;He set those things above us for signs.&nbsp;
Cannot earth be a sign to herself?&nbsp; Cannot man be his own
directory?&nbsp; Cannot the seas and the mountains and the rivers and trees
and houses be their own tokens?&nbsp; Try this.&nbsp; Let that ship at sea,
on which the fog has settled, ask the waves to say where is north, south,
east or west; and when the gale springs up and the clouds cover the heavens
let her ask the winds to tell how far from port.&nbsp; No, if the heavens
give no signs she has none, she cannot tell where she is or whither she is
going.</p>
<p>Suppose you find yourself within a mile of the house in which you were
born: you know, <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>as you think, every step of the way as well as
you know your own bedroom; but there is neither sun nor moon nor star, the
heavens are completely shut off and you are left to earth alone.&nbsp; Will
the trees tell you the way?&nbsp; Will the houses show themselves?&nbsp;
Will the road be its own exhibitor?&nbsp; No, if heaven fails you you
cannot even see your own hand.&nbsp; You are under the perpetual preaching
of the sky, that all your hours and all your movements are dependent upon
heaven!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For seasons&rdquo; as well as for signs.&nbsp; The Lord might
easily have established our lifetime under a different economy; might have
given us one perpetual summer, or a perpetual spring, or a uniform
co-existence of all the seasons, the fruits being sown, ripening and reaped
simultaneously.&nbsp; But not so.&nbsp; He has settled two things so
clearly that none, even the most sordid worm that ever wriggled under the
clay, showing himself above it as little as possible, can help seeing
them.&nbsp; First a fixed order that nothing can change and that proclaims
one Lord, one will, one dominion, one plan.&nbsp; The seasons come in
regular succession.&nbsp; Every man living knows when the summer is gone
that winter is coming.&nbsp; That will not and cannot be changed.&nbsp;
Were the whole world to conspire in one effort <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>that spring should come
next it would be unavailing.&nbsp; The winter is coming.&nbsp; But with
this fixed order is established perpetual change, variety, mutability, so
that although we know the season that is coming we know not what kind of a
season it shall be, and all our temporal interests hang upon that
question.&nbsp; When the merchant has got his stock, when the man of
pleasure has fixed for his party, when the General has planned his
campaign, when the Admiral has laid down the arrangements for the battle,
when the grand politician has perfected the plot for a new crisis of the
world, what must they do?&nbsp; Not look to what the earth but what the
heaven will do.&nbsp; Everything depends upon that.&nbsp; They cannot
decide the market price even of hard sovereigns, they cannot foretell the
value of their wheat, they cannot determine the life and health of their
soldiers or the hours and effect of movements independent of that one
consideration, what will the heavens do?&nbsp; Three days rain will change
a whole campaign or a harvest.&nbsp; By the arrangement of the seasons we
are constantly kept at the door of Divine mercy, begging &ldquo;Give us
this day our daily bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; That eternal voice preaching through
all our temporal interests is to us the solemn, never-ceasing protest
against worldliness, earthliness, <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>vanity, living for time, living for the body;
and, above all, against every impure or ungodly method of attempting to
secure our temporal aims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For days&rdquo; as well as for seasons.&nbsp; The season passes
slowly, but the day&mdash;oh what a solemn appointment is that!&nbsp; When
the Lord made the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night it
would have been very easy for Him to make two suns so that we should bask
in perpetual daylight.&nbsp; But no, it was his will that our life should
be cut into very short lengths and that by a mark so deep, broad, black,
that the dullest man could not escape its impression.&nbsp; The dark gulf
that lies between the dead day and the day unborn is the ever recurring
remembrancer&mdash;Thy days are numbered; thy life is held under law; thy
time is a measured current of golden sands.&nbsp; Every particle as it
comes may easily slip away, if unwatched <i>will</i> slip, and once past
thy hand it will be borne off by the rushing river and thou shalt never see
it again, but if caught, held and brought to the mint of the great King it
will there be turned into precious coin to serve in perpetuity the double
purpose of enriching man and recording the majesty of God.&nbsp; Seize upon
thy days as they pass!&nbsp; The heavens tell thee to do it; the dark <!--
page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>and
mantled earth tells thee; thy drowsy faculties tell thee; thy weary limbs
tell thee; all are saying &ldquo;numbered, numbered, numbered.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Life is running away fast.</p>
<p>Not only for days but &ldquo;for years.&rdquo;&nbsp; The days, as I have
said, are short; they pass rapidly, and we calculate that the days of our
years are threescore years and ten.&nbsp; And when you come to multiply 70
by 365 it makes a very large number, and if we have lost a few handfuls of
days, well, cannot we make them up?&nbsp; Have we not been young, and are
we not in this pleasant watering place, where one must see life and have a
little pleasure, and if we do throw away a few days, why, cannot we recover
them?&nbsp; Can we say that of the years?&nbsp; Are the years so very
plentiful&mdash;such a large number assured to you that you can afford to
squander a few, to turn them not only to useless purposes but to bad
ones.&nbsp; Can you?&mdash;the years!&mdash;oh is not it wonderful, the way
in which thy Lord and my Lord, thy Creator and my Creator, marks out before
our eye the progress of the years?</p>
<p>Perhaps you may remember in childhood watching the day as it grew and
spread itself out, making conquests from the night and winning moments,
minutes, hours, till you began to think the day was going to do away the
night.&nbsp; You <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>saw it stretching over the hours that once were
dark till it seemed as if the tips of the sunset touched the tips of the
sunrise, and still the light was gaining so that in a little time the
darkness would be all driven away and it would be day the twenty-four hours
round.&nbsp; But just then the night began to come back and the day grew
shorter, dimmer, colder, and the darkness spread itself over the light till
it seemed as if in its turn the day was going to be quenched and darkness
to wrap up the whole twenty-four hours.&nbsp; But then the day
returned.</p>
<p>Was it an accident this first time?&nbsp; Would it ever occur
again?&nbsp; You watched it: just the same process and at the same time,
and you began to feel&mdash;it is a wheel! with its regulated, measured
appointed movement; steady, by rule it rises to a certain point, and then
comes down to a certain point, then turns again and comes up.&nbsp; It is a
perfectly balanced wheel, making its revolution steadily, steadily.&nbsp; I
did not fix those revolutions: the great Architect did!&nbsp; He knows how
many the wheel itself can perform; He knows what each revolution marks off
and what it accomplishes, and He knows too how many shall measure off my
thread of life.&nbsp; I do not know the number, you do not know; but this
we do know, it is marked upon the dial, and we are <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>tolerably sure it is
not more than threescore and ten.&nbsp; Suppose you saw the dial of life
before your eye as plain as that dial is and the hand pointing twenty,
thirty, forty, fifty of the divisions gone&mdash;gone never to
return!&nbsp; Suppose you felt that that hand was pressing forward and
would point and point to successive lines till at last, without a
moment&rsquo;s warning, the hour will strike and it is over, no
recall!&nbsp; Man of twenty, proud of thy youth! man of fifty, proud of thy
maturity! man of seventy, proud of thy years! are you prepared to meet your
God?&nbsp; Has your time been spent with a view to eternity?&nbsp; Has the
measure of your days been taken?&nbsp; Has the course of your years been
run in holiness?&nbsp; If not, by the deep voice of the heavens above thee;
that voice which evermore is speaking; by the night and the day, and the
season and the year, I charge thee prepare to meet thy God.&nbsp; For thy
time is passing and eternity at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy years shall not fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; The thought of man never
feels that it can say this to nature.&nbsp; He sees the stones themselves
have marks of age and decay&mdash;the very mountains, the very seas tell of
change and limit.&nbsp; And in the skies too far off for us to trace decay
we trace something else&mdash;measure.&nbsp; Everything is measured.&nbsp;
The moon goes by measure and the sun by measure, <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>and the way of the
stars is all measured.&nbsp; There are clear tokens that not one of them is
its own master or gives its own law.&nbsp; One government moulds them
all.&nbsp; They say &ldquo;We serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; I take up the blade of
grass and at once feel He that made that grass made the light of day, the
dew of the morning, the beast that feeds upon it.&nbsp; One law pervades
them all.&nbsp; I take up the corn.&nbsp; He that made that made the sun
that ripens it and the soil that fattens it, and my blood that is my
life.&nbsp; Everywhere is one mind, one plan, one hand, one sceptre, and
all nature says &ldquo;I serve, I serve.&nbsp; There is a force external to
myself.&nbsp; I am measured.&nbsp; I move by rule.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
revolve,&rdquo; says every wheel in the heaven, &ldquo;I roll round by
regular law.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Measure&rdquo; always means
&ldquo;beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp; That which is measured must have
begun.&nbsp; Beginning always suggests the possibility of end.&nbsp; That
which once was not hereafter may not be.&nbsp; Nature fails to fill the
mind of man in any one of the three directions&mdash;the past, the future,
the outward and the infinite.&nbsp; It cannot fill up this thought of ours
that claims an eternity before, an eternity coming, an infinity on every
side; and we feel nature is like ourselves&mdash;a servant, a creature, a
machine, an organ, and every part of it proclaims a mind that lived before
it.</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>Then will all things fail? all decay?&nbsp; No&mdash;&ldquo;Thy
years shall not fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; We turn to Him that made the law whereby
the blade of grass grows, that whereby the sun statedly comes to it, that
whereby the animal feeds upon it, that whereby the man lives upon the
animal, and that whereby the human mind reigns over the animal, cultivates
the grass and makes use of the light.&nbsp; We come to that great Being
whom all these things indicate and proclaim.&nbsp; In Him we find no
external law or force compelling Him.&nbsp; At his footstool all say
&ldquo;We serve,&rdquo; and to all He says either &ldquo;Be&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Do&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do not.&rdquo;&nbsp; We find in Him no internal
decay.&nbsp; Years come, ages come, worlds arise and worlds pass away, but
&ldquo;Thou art the same&rdquo;&mdash;the same in strength, the same in
youth, the same in beauty, the same in glory, the same in wisdom.&nbsp;
Never old, only &ldquo;ancient of days.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Over all, God
blessed for ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The years of his divine existence shall never fail, the years of his
redeeming reign shall never fail.&nbsp; As I said, this Scripture is quoted
from the hundred and second Psalm.&nbsp; If you turn to it you will find in
it a contrast between man&rsquo;s perishing life and the eternal lifetime
of the Lord; and especially the glorious lifetime of his Messiah and
Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;My days are like a <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>shadow that declineth,
I am withered like grass.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bible makes everything
preach&mdash;it makes the sparrow preach and the bush preach, and the grass
and the lily.&nbsp; It makes even the very shadows preach&mdash;&ldquo;My
days are like a shadow that declineth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps sometime in the
morning you have stood and seen the great tree lying on the east of the
hill, throwing its shadow broad and thick over the hill-side as if it
really was a substance.&nbsp; But as the sun went up in the sky that shadow
gradually shrank down until it totally disappeared under the leaves of the
tree.&nbsp; My days are like that shadow&mdash;perhaps not like that
only.&nbsp; You may have seen in the very bright moonlight shadows lying
across the street till they looked solid as if they were something, so much
so that the young colt started from them.&nbsp; But a cloud passed over the
moon and where was the shadow?&nbsp; My days are like that.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto
all generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remembrance of man is calling to mind
those who are no more; the remembrance of God is calling to mind Him that
is unseen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy remembrance shall endure unto all
generations.&nbsp; Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion: for the time
to favour her, yea, the set time is come.&nbsp; For thy servants take
pleasure in her stones, and favour <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the dust thereof.&nbsp;
So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the
earth thy glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only will his days endure but his kingdom
will endure; not only will it endure but it will go forward with a
perpetual progress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shall arise and have mercy upon
Zion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord is building a city in the world, a city that
hath foundations, a city that is compacted together, a city that has its
families and houses and companies, its solemnities and social joys; a city
that is all one brotherhood though composed of every nation and kindred and
people.&nbsp; The Lord will arise in his strength to build this city and
one of the signs for his time to favour her is when her children take
pleasure in her stones and favour the dust thereof.&nbsp; We have that sign
in our day.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s children are taking pleasure in the stones of
Zion and favouring the dust thereof.&nbsp; Let us then, looking at the
sign, lift up our eye for the fulfilment of the promise, &ldquo;When the
Lord shall build up Zion, He shall appear in his glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are
trying to build Zion and the Lord is pleased to see it; but let us call
upon Him&mdash;&ldquo;Appear in thy glory!&nbsp; Do thou come and
build!&nbsp; Give us the living stones, bring them to us by thy power out
of the rocks, out of the heights and depths we cannot reach unto wilt thou
not bring living stones to thy <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>temple?&rdquo;&nbsp; Call and He will come and
He will build, and &ldquo;the heathen shall fear the name of the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will say, &ldquo;They have not heard it yet&rdquo;&mdash;but they
shall.&nbsp; You say many that have heard it do not fear it, but they
shall, they shall fear the name of the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;and all the kings
of the earth thy glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; The kings fear his glory!&nbsp; They
think of ancestral glory, courtly glory, military glory, political glory;
they do not think about Christ and his glory.&nbsp; But they shall, they
shall fear his glory.&nbsp; The proudest kings in the earth shall feel that
the glory of Jesus Christ of Nazareth is to them much as the sun is to that
shadow I have spoken of upon the hill.&nbsp; Their glory must pale and pass
away.&nbsp; It is but a little time ago, only nineteen centuries ago, since
Christ had no kingdom in the earth, no follower, no temple, no power.&nbsp;
Now is there a monarch in the world will come out and say, &ldquo;I shall
sweep the name, the law, the love, the power of Christ out of the
earth?&rdquo;&nbsp; No, of all powers now acknowledged there is none so
deep, wide and mighty.</p>
<p>Every day adds to that power; every year opens to it new spheres, new
languages, new adherents, and on will it go and on till the whole earth is
subdued under the power of the Lord and his <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Christ.&nbsp; What is
the instrument of its progress?&nbsp; &ldquo;He will regard the prayer of
the destitute and not despise their prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not despise
prayer!&nbsp; Why, do not the wise men of the world despise prayer?&nbsp;
Do not many talkers tell us that prayer is a thing not to be looked upon as
a force in the light of elevated reason?&nbsp; You may despise it if you
please and try to rear a kingdom over human souls on a system that
does.&nbsp; God will not despise it, Christ will not despise it.&nbsp;
There is a kingdom to be invoked by prayer, with its throne and its crown
and its sceptre.&nbsp; All the powers of that kingdom are moved with the
cry of a destitute heart.&nbsp; It is so, and you cannot alter it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This shall be written for the generation to come,&rdquo; how you go
and write down that prayer is of no effect, and we will write &ldquo;He
will not despise their prayer,&rdquo; and let the &ldquo;generation to
come&rdquo; judge.&nbsp; Your predecessors, eighteen hundred years ago,
wrote what you say&mdash;ours wrote these words, and see the kingdom of
Christ to-day!&nbsp; &ldquo;This shall be written for the generation to
come: and the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; What people &ldquo;shall praise the
Lord?&rdquo;&nbsp; The people that are in Jerusalem?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; In
Rome? in Athens?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; What people?&nbsp; The people that are not
anywhere; the people that are neither in heaven nor in earth; &ldquo;the
people that shall be <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>created.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That shall be
created&rdquo;&mdash;existences now not existing, beings now not being,
offspring of God and members of the family of immortals not yet
born&mdash;they shall praise the Lord.&nbsp; Coming up out of the dark of
that great future they shall rise to obey the King we worship and to praise
the Saviour we love.&nbsp; &ldquo;For He hath looked down from the height
of his sanctuary: from heaven did the Lord behold the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ay, from that holy place, that sanctuary&mdash;from that high place, that
heaven&mdash;He looked to behold this earth, this vile place, this base
place.&nbsp; Yet it was not to curse it&mdash;He looked &ldquo;to hear the
groaning of the prisoner; and to loose those that are appointed to
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here in every corner of the world you will see a man
who is appointed to death, accused, guilty, a lawbreaker, with witness
heard and evidence taken and judgment recorded&mdash;the sentence is
against him.&nbsp; Oh, if we had an eye such as looks from above how many
might we see in this fair congregation who are condemned to death.&nbsp;
You know it; you are breakers of eternal law; just judgment is against you;
you are appointed to death, and unless you are delivered from that
condemnation die you shall, die by a public execution before all worlds in
the great day.&nbsp; But He comes to deliver them &ldquo;that are appointed
to death&rdquo;&mdash;<!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>to bring you pardon, to bring yon salvation, to
bring you mercy, to make you a child of God, to blot out all the sin that
you have committed.&nbsp; Christ died that you might be delivered; reigns
that you may be delivered, and this day He is speaking to thy heart that
thou mayest turn from thy sin, seek mercy and follow Him in the way of
life.</p>
<p>So the Psalmist goes on ever anticipating the growth and stability of
this kingdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened
my days.&rdquo;&nbsp; God does not make his Church and work to depend upon
the length of any man&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said, O my God take me
not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all
generations.&nbsp; Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and
the heavens are the work of thy hands.&nbsp; They shall perish, but thou
shalt endure? yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture
shall thou change them, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same,
and thy years shall have no end.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay, and there is something
else that has no end.&nbsp; The heavens shall perish, the earth shall
perish.&nbsp; God will endure.&nbsp; And will nothing else endure.&nbsp;
Yes, &ldquo;The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
shall be established before thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The servants, the children
of God, those that are <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>born again by the Spirit&rsquo;s grace, those
that come to Christ, the Messiah, and through Him recover, by adoption, the
place in the family of God that was lost by sin, they shall continue, they
shall be established.&nbsp; What! when the earth flees away?&nbsp; Yes,
when the earth flees away.&nbsp; What! when the heaven falls?&nbsp; Yes,
when the heaven falls; they shall be established with the same immortality
as their Father in heaven.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy years shall not
fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; God will not fail; Christ will not fail; the Rock of
Ages will not fail; and all and every one that through Christ is in God
will never fail.&nbsp; The world will pass away, the word of God will not
pass away, and the child of God will not pass away.</p>
<p>Take then this word to thy heart and say &ldquo;Thy years shall not
fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will give you a worthy fear.&nbsp; Man is always
rightly or wrongly fearing something.&nbsp; One is afraid of a man that has
him in his power.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;If I offended him I should lose my
bread; it would be as much as my living is worth; I must take care not to
offend him;&rdquo; and rather than offend that man he will stain his
conscience and offend his God.&nbsp; Come back in twenty years and ask
where that man is, and they will take you to his grave, and that was what
you were afraid of!&nbsp; Another fears this bright, witty, active young
man, whose <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>word either cuts or flatters with amazing power.&nbsp; He feels as
if he could not face him; as if he could not bear that he should look him
in the face and call him a saint or tell him he had been praying to God or
been commending his soul for mercy to Christ.&nbsp; If he said these things
to him it would actually appear as if it was something against him,
something he ought to be ashamed of!&nbsp; Come back in twenty years and
enquire for him&mdash;perhaps you will find him in a mad-house, perhaps in
a gambling-house, perhaps in chains among convicts.&nbsp; Perhaps you will
find a broken-hearted mother in black, wishing that he had never been born,
and that is what you are afraid of!&nbsp; Another is afraid of the
fashion.&nbsp; Every one does it, and if he did not do it he would be
remarked.&nbsp; Every one says there is no harm in it, and if he scrupled
they would make fun of him, and on this account he will do a thing that he
knows ought not to be done.&nbsp; Come back in two generations and enquire
from the grandchildren of these people about this fashion and you will find
they are all laughing at the folly of their grandfathers and
grandmothers.&nbsp; And that is what you are afraid of!&nbsp; Set the Lord
alway before you.&nbsp; Say, &ldquo;Thy years shall not fail.&nbsp; Thou
art worthy to be feared.&nbsp; I will fear thee.&nbsp; Thou hast
power&mdash;power over my breath, over <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>my body, over my day,
over my night&mdash;power to destroy both body and soul in hell; power to
kill, power to make alive; power to condemn, power to save; power to cast
me down, power to lift me up to heaven&mdash;I will fear thee, O God in
Christ, and be thou my only fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Set the Lord alway before you and there you will find a sure
refuge.&nbsp; Nature is changing and decaying, and we are changed faster
than nature.&nbsp; We are all passengers in a ship that is floating in an
ocean and has fire in her hold.&nbsp; This air around us has an ocean in
it, an ocean of real water, and did God will it a little change in the
weight of the air would bring a universal deluge.&nbsp; This earth has fire
in it, stores of fire, and did God will a very little change in the
chemistry of the air it would be a universal blaze.&nbsp; We are
passengers, I say, in a ship sailing in an ocean with fire in the hold, and
we know that the fire is to break out and that the moment will come when
the ship will be burnt up.&nbsp; You and I are pacing this deck with the
fire beneath, and the day, the hour, the moment, that the signal will be
given no man living can tell.&nbsp; Are we prepared to meet our God?&nbsp;
Can we look forth from this frail world unto that infinite bosom of eternal
rest and say, &ldquo;Thou art mine and I am thine to all
eternity?&rdquo;&nbsp; You may look to other <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>refuges but they are
not secure, to other coverts but they are not safe.&nbsp; Here is the Rock
of Ages and that rock is cleft for you.&nbsp; God manifest in the
flesh.&nbsp; Behold Christ crucified and flee to Him, flee for refuge, flee
to-day; once in Christ you will know that you are safe.&nbsp; Let the storm
come, let the winds blow, let the floods beat, let the fires break out,
safe! safe! safe!&nbsp; Nothing can move Him and nothing can touch
thee.&nbsp; Thou shalt &ldquo;dwell under the shadow of the Most
High.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Set the Lord alway before thee and you will have an unfailing stay, an
unfailing resource.&nbsp; Many things you may think will not fail.&nbsp;
Here is the old man, and his friends tell him he does not fail, and how he
likes to hear it!&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy years do not weigh thee
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes on and it seems as if to him the years come as
the snow falls on the mountains, not to enfeeble but to embellish.&nbsp; He
does not fail.&nbsp; Ay, but he will fail and be bowed down to the
dust.&nbsp; And the wiry woman that has gone through enough to kill many
and yet hath more spirit and energy than the young.&nbsp; Ay, she shall
fail too; you will see her smitten and trodden under the grass.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well I know I must fail,&rdquo; one says, &ldquo;I <i>am</i>
failing, but then there is my boy, I shall never want some one to lean
upon, I can trust him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>he may fail; you may
stand by the grave where they are saying, &ldquo;Dust to dust,&rdquo; or
you may with your hands over your eyes look upon a sadder grave where his
character lies corrupting.&nbsp; Another says, &ldquo;Well, I know I am
failing, but there is my daughter so good and sweet and true&mdash;I shall
never want a comforter for my old age.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, you do not know,
she may fail, you may have to weep over her coffin or to blush over her
faults.&nbsp; And another says, &ldquo;Well, I have never depended upon
anything but my own honest industry.&nbsp; I have something to rely
upon.&nbsp; Mine is not speculation, it is good steady business&mdash;I can
trust it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can you? can you?&nbsp; God may permit you by one
mistake to undo the doing of a life.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I am not depending
upon the chances of business&mdash;my position is secure&mdash;settled
property.&nbsp; I shall not fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Are you sure?&nbsp; You know
not the ways by which earthly things can make themselves wings and flee
away; or if they do not flee you may depart from them.&nbsp; Another says,
&ldquo;Well, I have never trusted to anything but my right hand and I shall
not want&mdash;wherever I go I can take care of myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay,
but suppose the right hand should fail?&nbsp; As long as the strong arm and
the strong will work together it is well, but suppose a day should come
when an invisible knife should pass between the <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>arm and the will: and
the will said, &ldquo;Stretch forth!&rdquo; but the arm hung idle by the
side.&nbsp; It may fail.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, but my heart never fails me;
whatever goes wrong I can make the best of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But suppose
your heart should fail and that you became one of those to whom the
grasshopper was a burden, one that made the worst of everything, that could
look no difficulty in the face.&nbsp; Your heart may fail, your flesh may
fail, your money may fail, your employ may fail, your friends may fail,
everything upon earth may fail.&nbsp; If you have Christ for your friend
you will never fail, if you have God for your Father you have a shelter, a
home, a comfort that will never fail.&nbsp; If you have not you have
nothing that you can count upon.&nbsp; Then come this day, come and say to

the storm that is coming, so that amid the change of life and the ruin of
death, the awe of the judgment-day, my spirit may abide under an
everlasting shelter! may look forward to the eternity that is to be and say

89</span>GOD&rsquo;S CONTROVERSY WITH MAN.<br />
REV. CHARLES PREST.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; and because I will
do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Amos</span> iv. 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chapter refers to the condition of Israel at the time of this
prophecy, and to the expostulation and threatened procedure of God
concerning the nation.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s people had revolted from Him; they
had sunk into idolatry; they had been often reproved, but had hardened
their necks, and therefore the Lord, after recapitulating the calamities
which had befallen them, and which all came in the way of fatherly
chastisements for their recovery to righteousness, and indicating that his
anger was not turned away, says, &ldquo;and because I will do this unto
thee&rdquo;&mdash;and because having done this repentance does not appear,
then prepare to meet me.&nbsp; That is, meet me in battle.&nbsp; If you
will not submit, <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>then let the battle be fought; if you will not
bow down to these kind modes of discipline&mdash;kindly intentioned,
however terrible in execution, then prepare to meet me.&nbsp; This
expostulation proceeds upon a very intelligible principle&mdash;a
principle, however, which we sometimes sadly forget, and which we are too
much in the habit of neglecting&mdash;on the principle that man is an
accountable creature; and secondly, that God will call him to account for
his conduct.</p>
<p>God has a controversy with man, with us&mdash;a controversy with us
because of our sin, our sin being an outrage against the divine love; a
controversy with us because He is right and we are wrong; because He
designs the welfare of all, and the sin that we love is productive of
universal destruction; a controversy with sinners that can only be
terminated in one of two ways&mdash;a controversy with every unconverted
person here to-day.&nbsp; Do not deceive yourselves: if you are strangers
to the life of God, you are in opposition to Him, and with you as sinners
there is a controversy only to be terminated&mdash;first, by your
submission, your repentance&mdash;and, thank God, He has prepared a perfect
and suitable method for our submission, and for our repentance.&nbsp; If He
has a controversy with us, He wills it to be terminated in such a mode as
shall secure the <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>original purpose of his great love, which our
sin has outraged.&nbsp; Christ has appeared in our behalf, and for this
purpose has offered a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation,
and satisfaction for our sins.&nbsp; For this purpose the Divine Spirit
waits in all our assemblies, and now in this place, that any of you who are
now enemies to Him by wicked works, being pricked in your hearts on account
of your sins, and groaning under your condemnation, may fly for refuge to
the hope set before you in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp; So God would have
this controversy terminated.&nbsp; So He invites you in his great mercy to
terminate it.&nbsp; And for this purpose we are ministers of
reconciliation, and &ldquo;we pray you in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye
reconciled to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is but one other way of terminating this controversy, and that is
by our destruction.&nbsp; If we will abide in our controversy, if we will
wage the battle to the end, this destruction must ensue, here is no method
else&mdash;no escape any where between the one extreme and the other; it is
submission and life, it is battle and death&mdash;death eternal.&nbsp; O
that death eternal!&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Not the annihilation of your
souls.&nbsp; What is the death of a soul?&nbsp; The loss of the life of
God&mdash;the loss of communion with God.&nbsp; The soul is made for such a
communion: this is its true life; <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>it has no satisfaction apart from this
enjoyment.&nbsp; There cannot be communion without love; that is the soul
of communion; and if you renounce the reign of love, and come under the
dominion of enmity, you cut yourselves off from the life of God, you die,
and must endure the bitter pains of eternal death.&nbsp; I pray God that
you may terminate this controversy, and thank God that you may do so, by
the submission of your hearts to his merciful provision of salvation, that
so you may live in hallowed Christian blessedness here, and inherit perfect
fellowship and communion with God hereafter.</p>
<p>We should humble ourselves in the presence of that great calamity which
has fallen upon our flocks and upon our herds.&nbsp; I think it is well in
times of public calamity that public attention should be called to these
things; and our attention has been called thereto&mdash;not, it is true, by
the governing authorities of the country.&nbsp; No matter for that.&nbsp;
It is right that we should listen to the admonition that we have received
in our own denomination, and do all we can rightly to humble ourselves, and
above all, earnestly to pray to God that He would take away the evil from
us, and that, in taking away the evil, He would render us the less liable
to promote the dire necessity of future visitation.&nbsp; Let me then call
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>your
attention to some general principles connected with God&rsquo;s dealings
with the nations.</p>
<p>There is a national as well as an individual providence.&nbsp; In the
ancient government of God over the nations of the earth, in his dealings
with his own people and with the heathen peoples about them, his hand was
clearly discerned on many occasions, and his arm sometimes made bare.&nbsp;
There were the predictions of certain events to come, and there was the
recognised accomplishment of those predictions sometime afterwards.&nbsp;
Then, again, you find miraculous interpositions of correction, of
punishment, or of deliverance.&nbsp; If you turn your attention to the
history of God&rsquo;s Church, you find all these things manifest; you find
Israel in Egypt; then the command that they should be allowed to pass away
from their bondage; you find Egypt resisting the command, and God sent
among the people of Egypt signs and wonders, and plagues by the hand of
Moses, but they submitted not.&nbsp; He called them to obedience, but they
rebelled.&nbsp; By and bye, He slew their firstborn, the chief of all their
strength, and then the people came out with silver and with gold.&nbsp;
Nations are not simply chastised in this world, they are also
punished.&nbsp; Every one of us shall give an account of himself to God at
the last great day, and <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>strictly speaking, the punishment of separate
individuals will not begin in this life; but nations cannot be judged
collectively hereafter; they are dealt with here; and God&rsquo;s dealings
with the nations stand out in his palpable acts with these Egyptians.&nbsp;
They saw the hand of God for a time, but they fell back into their ancient
rebellion and pursued the Israelites to the Red Sea, and God made that sea
a way for his ransomed and destroyed the pursuing host.&nbsp; Go through
the entire history of God&rsquo;s ancient people.&nbsp; You find the
Assyrians round about Jerusalem, you see the angel of God going forth, and
that mighty host is destroyed.&nbsp; Go through all the dealings of God
with heathen nations, and you find these physical manifestations of
God&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; In our day there are no such manifestations as
these.&nbsp; In modern times the events of the divine government are not so
authoritatively predicted, and the exceedingly foolish attempts of some
people to interpret prophecy and to apply it arbitrarily to passing events
cannot be too severely condemned.&nbsp; They tend greatly to prejudice the
proper interpretation of Scriptural prophecy before the world, and deserve
severe reprehension, and should be altogether discountenanced by all men of
sound mind.&nbsp; In our day we have not these authoritative predictions of
events.&nbsp; But <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>amid all this there is a tendency to ignore the
action of God in the government of the world altogether.&nbsp; Instead of
recognising his presence or acknowledging his power, the varied
events&mdash;political, social, and otherwise&mdash;events like the one to
which I have just referred, affecting the nation, are denied their true
character; and the view that I have ventured to place before you in many
places would be treated with ridicule.&nbsp; Men say, when they look at
political events, that they are to be traced to the conclusions of
well-directed political economy, or to the failure of the application of
sound principles of government.&nbsp; I know very well that if the
pestilence comes there are men who trace it to no higher than physical
causes.&nbsp; I know very well that if great calamities happen in storm or
tempest the physical cause is alone recognised.&nbsp; And with reference to
the scourge of our cattle clever men look, as they ought, after the
physical causes.&nbsp; They look, as I think they are bound, to the
development of the evil influences leading to such a result.&nbsp; But if
men now-a-days are Christian enough to recognise God in the parliament of
this country there is no great response, unless it be a response of
ill-concealed scorn; and even among people who profess more of Christianity
there is a danger of leaving the stern, <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>enlightened, and
faithful recognition of God which distinguished our fathers, and of
looking, in some fancied superiority of our intellect&mdash;which is but a
fancy; for there were wise men before us&mdash;for explanation in
something, in anything oft-times, rather than the recognition of
God&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>Remember this, however, brethren, that the principles of God&rsquo;s
government in our day are the same which have inhered in that government in
all ages&mdash;that, however human circumstances may differ, however the
nations of this world may alter, however the powers of men may vary time
after time, God&rsquo;s government is an immutable thing; it changes
not.&nbsp; The perfect idea of a human government is this&mdash;I do not
say it is realised&mdash;to have certain fixed principles that are to
abide, and then in the application of those principles to find an
elasticity which shall meet every conceivable alteration of circumstances
about us.&nbsp; That is the idea of a perfect human government; but human
governments do not attain to it.&nbsp; The government of God, however, is
perfect.&nbsp; The great principle is love&mdash;&ldquo;God is love;&rdquo;
its great end, the welfare of man; the purpose of that government, the
spread of Christianity for the welfare of mankind.</p>
<p>There is no expediency in this government, as <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>men understand
it.&nbsp; The governments of this world are too much founded upon
expediency&mdash;the government of this country for the last sixty or
seventy years lamentably founded upon it.&nbsp; There was a time when there
was less of it here, but the disciples of expediency increase, and it is
now rather &ldquo;What is convenient?&rdquo; than &ldquo;What is
right?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is an expediency taught in the Bible, but it is
nothing more than the best way of doing the right thing.&nbsp; It never
truckles.&nbsp; The government of God knows nothing of our human
expedients; it knows a great deal of Divine arrangements, and God as truly
governs as though in his government of the nations He should work signs and
wonders and divers miracles daily.</p>
<p>God has spoken in the history of our own country.&nbsp; Look at some of
the startling events of the last two hundred years.&nbsp; You look at the
act of our noble, intelligent, never-to-be-sufficiently-admired, firm old
English ancestors, in driving James the Second from his throne, and working
out the glorious Revolution of 1688.&nbsp; Well, if you look at all this
politically, you speak of their wisdom, their fortitude, and their
indomitable spirit; you speak too of storm and tempest all working in their
favour.&nbsp; Aye, aye, but the hand of God was there, as much in sending
away that <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>unworthy King as God&rsquo;s hand was in sending Nebuchadnezzar to
feed among the oxen.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s hand may not appear in our modern
times as in former days, but faith sees that hand in the common affairs of
mankind.&nbsp; But because we do not see the operation, because the
operation is not palpable to men&rsquo;s senses, the agency of God is
forgotten.&nbsp; Depend upon it, it is a great mistake to imagine that if
we could see, now and then, some great miracle wrought, we should get into
the habit of recognising the power and wisdom of God.&nbsp; The Israelites
were fed in the desert by miracle, and rebelled against God whilst they ate
the food miraculously given to them.&nbsp; The wonder&mdash;the perfection
of the Divine operation is this, that without disturbing in our little
individual history any of the common affairs which arise in every-day life,
without working any miracle at all, and whilst to the eyes of men all
things continue as they were from the beginning, whilst there is nothing
observable in the method, He works all things together for the good of them
that love Him, combining opposing forces and blending together the elements
of life and of death in one grand atmosphere of benediction for the welfare
of the righteous, and all this without disturbing the ordinary course of
cause and effect.&nbsp; The power of God impresses itself <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>not merely through the
lower links of the chain of providence&mdash;cause and effect, but upon the
higher part of that chain which sends down its influence, its intelligence,
its all-wise benevolence, to work out the welfare of those that are the
objects of his love.</p>
<p>So it is with nations.&nbsp; You will see public events rising up in
connection with ordinary causes, but we ought to acknowledge the great
First-cause.&nbsp; The principles of divine government which operated in
the old time are now as surely in operation as they were then.&nbsp; They
are not antiquated: they are not at all supplanted; they operate in the
same way, to the same ends; they operate to national and personal benefit,
to national and personal reproof, or, in the neglect of such admonition, to
national and personal punishment, showing us that God&rsquo;s government is
now the government which it was in the ancient days, and that though we see
no miracles in our day God is as much in the midst of unthinking multitudes
as when men were startled by the visible interposition of his Almighty
power.</p>
<p>Let us look, then, at the state of things about us now.&nbsp; Is there
not sufficient cause in this land to lead us to humble ourselves, to
improve the admonition of our God; that we should prepare <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>to meet Him,
in the only way in which we can meet Him to our profit, by our personal
submission to a greater extent; and if we love our country, that we should
put ourselves into a position to bring the nation out of any state of
rebellion against God, to lead it back to a more perfect reconciliation
with Him?&nbsp; What evils have we now to deplore?&nbsp; Why, a great
number.&nbsp; It is a blessed land after all; and there is more of
Christianity found in it than in any other in the world.&nbsp; There is
doubtless more of the direct influence of Christianity in our population
than you will find elsewhere, and certainly more of the indirect influence
upon the constitution of the nation, upon our legislation, upon our
national&mdash;aye, and upon our domestic habits.&nbsp; There is a large
amount of the indirect influence of Christianity in our midst, for which we
have cause to be thankful.&nbsp; But then, on the other hand, how much is
there of evil?&nbsp; There is great evil in our midst.&nbsp; There is
first, what really our fathers had not so much to do with&mdash;there is
the presence and power of a subtle, of a most ably-wrought and
powerfully-patronised Popery, about which we have been asleep for too long
a time, Popery, which is inimical to the welfare of any nation, and
inconsistent with the political happiness, prosperity and security of any
people.&nbsp; You <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>have not far to go for the proof of
this.&nbsp; You have only to go to the present miserable condition of
Ireland to prove it.&nbsp; It is all very well for disclaimers to arise
from the men who created the disloyal element of this mischief, but they
must esteem the Protestants of this country more credulous than I hope they
will prove if they expect them to believe their present
protestations.&nbsp; What else have you?&nbsp; You have the presence of
this Popery also where Protestantism alone ought to be known.&nbsp; You
have it dishonestly intruded into the temples of Christian truth; and you
have the pernicious nonsense of miserable and disgraceful antics obtruded
into what men call divine worship, utterly beneath the dignity of sensible
men.&nbsp; You have another thing.&nbsp; You have infidelity, and in the
pulpit too&mdash;the pulpit in high places&mdash;infidelity in its worst
form.&nbsp; You have all this, and no power, and very little inclination
exists to correct it.&nbsp; You have all this, and multitudes love to have
it so.&nbsp; That is one form of evil, leading to many other forms, and
causing all thoughtful men to deplore the condition of churches cursed with
a schism like this, with a false doctrine and heresy so utterly opposed to
the truth and to the salvation of men.&nbsp; Well, then, look, at the
profanity of the people around us.&nbsp; Look at the ungodliness of decent
<!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>people.&nbsp; I am not here to-day to call your attention simply,
as people sometimes do, to the lowest classes of society.&nbsp; They are
bad enough.&nbsp; They are a festering mass at the foundation of all the
greatness of the nation; they are a mass which, if not corrected in their
tendencies, may at any time be quickened into an activity that will utterly
wreck the entire superstructure of all that as Christians and as Englishmen
we hold dear.&nbsp; But higher up, where there is no profaneness or
criminality, or gross and disgusting visible intemperance, what other evils
are there?&nbsp; There is decency, but there is an absence of the
recognition of God.&nbsp; God is not in men&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; And
there is a fearful and fatal indifference as to the claims of religion that
has come over the nations.&nbsp; Multitudes neglect public worship.&nbsp; I
apprehend the least evidence that anybody can give of religious impression,
or of recognition of the claims of religion, is that they should attend the
public worship of Almighty God.&nbsp; You find, however, hundreds of
thousands in this nation who never attend divine service.&nbsp; If our
churches and chapels in London were to be attended next Sunday by the usual
number of persons, and those besides who ought to attend were disposed to
try to gain admission at any one time during the day, we have not half
churches and chapels <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>enough to hold them; whilst, as it is, the
room provided is not occupied.&nbsp; This indifference is a fearful
thing.&nbsp; Paul yearned over his countrymen, but in some respects our
countrymen are worse than Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could wish,&rdquo;
said that glorious, patriotic man&mdash;that grand old man, that most
blessed and chief of all the Apostles, with heaven in his view, his career
well-nigh ended, his work done, and Churches rising up around him of which
he was the father&mdash;not churches built upon other men&rsquo;s
foundations&mdash;&ldquo;I could wish myself accursed from Christ for my
brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet &ldquo;I bear
them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to
knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; In England, at this day, there are multitudes of
whom it may be said, &ldquo;God is not in all their thoughts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the heathenism spread about us is as bad in its developments as in any
other part of the world, and more aggravated in its character because of
its immediate proximity with the light and truth of our blessed
Christianity.&nbsp; There is in this land, too, an absorbing of men in
worldliness: this, perhaps, comes nearer to us.&nbsp; In my time I have
seen worldliness not only enthralling obviously and professedly worldly
men.&nbsp; I have seen worldliness come into the Church&mdash;aye, among
Methodists.&nbsp; How many <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>young men have I seen, earnest, zealous,
devoted, doing just that work for God which must be done by young men if
the population of this land is to be won to Christ&mdash;they enter into
business-life, by-and-bye God prospers their industry, and they begin to
thrive in the world; and what then?&nbsp; Oh, then this fervour
abates&mdash;they get immersed in earthly things.&nbsp; We lose their
activities in the Church; the ungodly part of the world lose the influence
of a blessed example and of their Christian teaching.&nbsp; They are too
busy to attend to the service of God at all on the week days, they say to
their ministers: &ldquo;We will find the money if you will send men to do
the work among these poor people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Find money to do it!&nbsp;
So they ought: but do they think they place the Church under obligation by
doing that?&nbsp; Not a whit.&nbsp; They ought to be thankful to the
Church, and to the God of the Church, that He will have their money, that
God permits them gratefully to recognise in this way their stewardship; but
I say to every such person, if you think you can purchase exemption from
personal devotion to God, and from such devotion as shall lead you to
spread the truth by your personal labour, to the utmost extent of your
ability, you are greatly mistaken.&nbsp; We can have no such compositions
of <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>God&rsquo;s claim; you must not dream of them.&nbsp; There is a
feebleness, therefore, of the Church; oft-times arising from this cause, a
feebleness we must seek to cure, as it only can be cured, by an increase of
our own personal godliness.</p>
<p>But how do we stand just now?&nbsp; God has sometimes admonished this
nation for its ungodliness.&nbsp; I do not speak of the nation now as
profane or criminal.&nbsp; Take the best view of it.&nbsp; And I remember
that a great theologian has said, the true view of man&rsquo;s depravity is
not that every man is profane or intemperate or mischievous&mdash;the great
proof of the universal depravity of man is found in man&rsquo;s
ungodliness&mdash;in his not recognising the claims of God, and not bowing
to his love.&nbsp; We have had admonition after admonition, within our own
lives, most of us.&nbsp; Not long since God sent a pestilence into our
midst&mdash;on two remarkable occasions.&nbsp; Well do I remember the state
of the people where I was labouring in one of the large towns of this
country, with between three and four hundred deaths, from cholera,
occurring every week.&nbsp; The people were alarmed.&nbsp; There was a
national day of humiliation and prayer; our places of worship were
crowded.&nbsp; The people were alarmed, but they were not permanently
impressed.&nbsp; God heard prayer; yes, he delights to hear prayer.&nbsp;
God <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>answered it; he delights to answer it.&nbsp; The evil passed
away; the concern passed with it; and I shall never forget the contrast
between the congregations on the day of humiliation, and when they were
summoned to thank God for the removal of the scourge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were
there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is only four years ago that another check came upon the
nation&mdash;that one of our great branches of national industry became
suddenly paralysed; and what mercy was there in that!&nbsp; There was the
good hand of God in the administration of that chastisement, in the conduct
of the people under such calamities, and in the absence of mischievous,
designing men from among them.&nbsp; I have known the time when that
population would have been inflamed by a calamity of far less consequence
to acts of the greatest violence.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s hand was there.&nbsp;
He chastised the nation; but He guided the chastisement.&nbsp; And now
again, another evil has come upon us&mdash;a greater evil, perhaps, than
people imagined at first&mdash;this plague among our herds.&nbsp; There
will be great loss to individuals, and no doubt there will be great loss to
all; for it is impossible for so much wealth or money&rsquo;s worth to be
destroyed in any nation without all the people in the nation feeling it
more or less.&nbsp; I <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>think it right, therefore, that we have been
called to recognise the hand of God therein&mdash;to look through all
external causes to his hand.&nbsp; It is a very dangerous thing, a thing I
have never done in my life, and never would do, to talk about the
providence of God in its punitive power, to talk about retribution in the
application of God&rsquo;s providence in individual cases.&nbsp; It is very
unwise to do that, and sometimes it may be most uncharitable.&nbsp; It is
different, however, in God&rsquo;s dealings with a nation.&nbsp; We are
admonished, or punished, by a great national calamity that has stirred all
classes of men each in their own way, and has raised all their activities
in order to see if evils of this kind may not be checked in their
operation.&nbsp; This evil is present with us.&nbsp; And then, as to other
evils that may arise.&nbsp; If you look abroad into the world, to the
relations of this country to other nations, you have peace just now; but he
would be a bold man who should predict the continuation of this peace for
any length of time.&nbsp; No, your statesmen cannot keep the peace of
nations; and the folly of our boasting about the peace-working power of our
commercial relations has already be seen.&nbsp; We cannot give peace to the
world.&nbsp; Who can tell how soon the calamity of war may afflict this
country?&nbsp; Not I trust on its shores; but what is this land <!-- page
108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>that it has
any right to expect a perpetual immunity from the horrors of war in her
midst?&nbsp; Do not say these things will pass away.&nbsp; Do not say these
things are remote.&nbsp; They may quickly overtake us, and we should be
careful that we do not provoke our God to hasten any of his judgments or to
aggravate present ones.&nbsp; If you are delivered from calamity&mdash;if
this great national calamity, for such it is, has not touched you, or at
least not so touched you as to inconvenience you at all, remember to give
sympathy to those that are suffering from it; and let thankfulness for your
present mercies manifest itself in that godly amendment of life which shall
prove your best contribution to the future safety and the prosperity of the
nation.&nbsp; If we neglect this we place ourselves in opposition to
God&rsquo;s government, and are in danger, by our opposition, of being told
to prepare to meet God in conflict.&nbsp; Individual sinners do so who
refuse repentance; nations do so that will not submit to God.&nbsp; You
that are living without God, pray what prospect have you, what prospect of
victory?&nbsp; The potsherd of the earth may strive with the potsherd, but
woe to the man that strives with his Maker.&nbsp; The God whom you are
called upon to meet is the &ldquo;God that formeth the mountains, that
createth the wind, that declareth unto man what is his <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>thought, that maketh
the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, the
Lord, the God of hosts, is his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let the ungodliness of this land increase&mdash;and it will increase if
we neglect the manifestation of godliness in opposition to it&mdash;and
what then?&nbsp; There will be the culmination of national sin, and there
will be the enactments of Parliament against the law of God, as on a former
memorable occasion in France; let it come to that, and let a crisis arise;
and though your statesmen should be the most sagacious, and have all the
ability which has ever distinguished the foremost men of the Government of
this land; let your Parliament be intelligent and patriotic; let your sons
be as brave on flood or field as their fathers; let your commerce be ever
so flourishing, your arts ever so perfect, your literature ever so
exalted&mdash;none of these things would save the nation&mdash;none of
these things would be an effectual shield against calamity; and upon the
wreck of this grand old realm&mdash;wrecked by its ungodliness, made rotten
at its base by sin&mdash;upon the wreck of this nation which, had it been
godly, would have borne the shock of all the earth, and dashed it back like
foam&mdash;on the wreck of Britain shall be written, &ldquo;The nation, the
kingdom, that will not serve thee shall perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
inscription <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>has been often written upon empires as magnificent, as powerful,
and as illustrious as this.</p>
<p>What, then, is our duty?&nbsp; What have we to do with this?&nbsp; We
who are gathered together in this chapel may say, can we arrest the course
of the nation?&nbsp; Can we turn back the floods of ungodliness?&nbsp; Can
we go out and produce an influence that may avert these calamities?&nbsp; I
do not say that you alone can do this; but I do say, that you are bound to
contribute your utmost to the check of these evils, with as perfect a
heart, and with as earnest a purpose, and as free a will, as though your
hand could dash back the evil and rescue the nation from its danger.</p>
<p>Our immediate duty is repentance.&nbsp; That is the duty of the
nation.&nbsp; But the word nation is a comprehensive one; we lose ourselves
in it.&nbsp; We may do as we are in danger of doing with the word Church,
lose sight of our own individual responsibility in confused ideas of what
the Church collectively is to do.&nbsp; God cannot yield in this conflict;
his righteousness forbids this.&nbsp; The nation must yield and become
obedient, or the result indicated must follow.&nbsp; If then the nation is
to repent, where is that repentance to begin?&nbsp; Why in this place
to-day, so far as we are concerned.&nbsp; In whose hearts must this <!--
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>repentance commence?&nbsp; Why in the hearts of every one of you
unconverted persons, that are rather contributing to the ungodliness of the
country than to the increase of its spiritual power.&nbsp; You may not be
drunkards, you may not be profligate; but if you are living without the
recognition of God&rsquo;s love and the enjoyment of his favour, you are
ungodly; and your first duty is to repent.&nbsp; There is no salvation
without this repentance, let some modern preachers say what they
will.&nbsp; The Master of all preachers sent the Apostles forth, and they
preached everywhere that men should repent.&nbsp; There is a fashionable
preaching, I am told, that has no repentance in it.&nbsp; So much the worse
for the people that listen to such error.&nbsp; There is no merit in
repentance; the only meritorious cause of your salvation is the
blood-shedding and the present and perfect atonement of Christ.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;the law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
old Puritans were right who said, that the soundest conversions were those
with which the law had most to do.&nbsp; Mount Sinai exhibited proofs of
God&rsquo;s love, and Christ, who died for us on Calvary, is the author and
enforcer of the whole law.&nbsp; There must be the bowing down of your
souls to the claims of the law, the struggle for amendment, the
renunciation of sin, the <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>recognition of your own hopelessness, and the
cry, &ldquo;What must I do to be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who shall
deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then comes Christ, and
peace, and joy; a participation in the divine nature; and a power to
contribute practically to the repentance of the nation.&nbsp; This is your
duty.</p>
<p>You Christian people, too, are called upon to repent.&nbsp; Depend upon
it as we go through life an act of repentance, once for all, will not do:
we shall need repentance daily.&nbsp; When a man is admitted to the favour
of God it is that his mouth should be stopped, it is that he should
entertain penitential feeling as long as he lives&mdash;not the penitence
of guilt, but the penitence of gratitude.&nbsp; The recollection, I am a
sinner, will inspire and maintain such penitence; and a blessed end that
man will make, who in the full meaning of the words, pours out the prayer
at the last, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; We need
repentance&mdash;we all need it.&nbsp; Let us turn our attention to
ourselves, and ascertain how much we have contributed to the existing evils
of the nation.&nbsp; How much have we contributed to the present state of
things which in the judgment of sober Christian concern may be held to have
provoked the anger of God?&nbsp; We may have contributed to these evils,
and I dare say we have, in two <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>ways: first, by neglect of duty.&nbsp; There
are sinners about you, you need not go far to find them&mdash;perhaps there
are some ungodly people in your own houses.&nbsp; What have you ever done
to make them godly?&nbsp; What effort have you made, what kind of an
example have you set them in your words, in your tempers, in your spiritual
aspirations?&nbsp; Now tell yourselves honestly.&nbsp; You have been living
with them up to this day, living with them during this day.&nbsp; What have
you said to them?&nbsp; Do your conduct and your words condemn their sin,
and invite them to reconciliation with God?&nbsp; What does conscience say
to this?&nbsp; What does the recollection of the past few hours say to
this?&nbsp; There are wicked people about you: some of you have leisure;
what have you done for your ungodly neighbours?&nbsp; What poor man&rsquo;s
house have you visited?&nbsp; What wretched sinner have you talked
to?&nbsp; You have passed along the streets, and have seen sin abounding;
have you ever tried to check it?&nbsp; Have you ever thought it worth while
to follow some half dozen people deeply immersed in sin, and by patient,
earnest, godly admonitions, counsels, and entreaties, have you sought the
salvation of their souls?&nbsp; Have you done this?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
you busy men say, &ldquo;we have not time.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know better; you
must not tell practical men that; they know that all of <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>us waste a great deal
more time than we want for such a purpose.&nbsp; It is not a question of
time at all, but a question of inclination.&nbsp; Have we done so?&nbsp;
Are evils abating by our instrumentality?&nbsp; Do not say, &ldquo;I could
do very little.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do what you can!&nbsp; &ldquo;If I could move
a multitude I would do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, that will not do.&nbsp; You
good women, are you doing all the good you can in your families?&nbsp; Do
you mothers give yourselves to the right training of your children?&nbsp;
Fathers, are you practically anxious for the spiritual good of your
families?&nbsp; Do you help your wives to bring up a godly family, which
shall prove a blessing to the nation; and not such an one as Dr. Paley
says, as shall turn out wild beasts upon society.&nbsp; You have little
ability; well, if you have not ten talents, do not bury the one
talent.&nbsp; Paul did one thing, and that was the secret of all his
greatness&mdash;he did <i>his</i> duty.&nbsp; Do you do <i>yours</i>?&nbsp;
There was a simplicity of purpose about him, an earnestness of endeavour, a
thoroughness in the doing of it that made him what he was, the greatest of
all apostles and the greatest man that the Christian Church has
known.&nbsp; Take that simple rule, you young people; strive to spread the
influence of a godly example among all about you: do what you can, in a way
consistent with <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>your position in life, and in a way consistent
altogether with modesty, humility, and a deep devotion to God, and you will
not labour in vain.&nbsp; We are guilty of sins of omission, and we need
repentance.</p>
<p>But how have we contributed to the evils of the nation by our
activities?&nbsp; Some of you were converted, perhaps, when you had lived
to be twenty years of age, some of you thirty or forty, some perhaps were
older; what kind of lives had you led before that time?&nbsp; How many of
your former companions did you injure by a godless example? perhaps by
foolish words, perhaps by ungodly actions.&nbsp; God has rescued you; where
are they?&nbsp; What has become of the seed you then planted in their
minds?&nbsp; If God drew out the roots of vice by his grace from your
hearts, the influence of this evil remains elsewhere.&nbsp; What mischief
is often done by men prior to their conversion in their families!&nbsp;
When you see there is so much wickedness in the land, then say, &ldquo;What
have I done to increase it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And I think we shall all find
great need to repent; great need to set an example of repentance to all
about us.</p>
<p>The first thing, then, is this deep humiliation of heart that shall
bring us all to bow before God, and cause us to join in the prayer,
&ldquo;Enter not into judgment with thy servants, O God, for <!-- page
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, then, you Christian
professors must bestir yourselves.&nbsp; This repentance must not be a
passing emotion, not a temporary influence, however powerful; but there
must be a correspondent continued effort to promote it amongst your
families and neighbours, and to the utmost extent of your power in the
world; engaging meanwhile in earnest prayer; and then consecrating
yourselves more fully to this work under the influence of two things, a
deep sense of personal responsibility and of the constraint of divine
love.&nbsp; Submit, then, to this will of God.&nbsp; Know the rod, and Him
that hath appointed it.&nbsp; If the multitudes about you do not know it
you know it.&nbsp; If God be not recognised, let it be yours to recognise
Him amid the surrounding worldliness, and depend upon it your purity of
heart shall increase, and you will see God in all things, in all
calamities, and in all joys.&nbsp; It is a strange thing that nations and
individuals see God more readily in trouble than they do in their
joys.&nbsp; Amid the immunities from ill which Christian people often enjoy
how little they think of God.&nbsp; Trouble comes, calamity comes, and we
owe the quickening of our religious feelings, strangely enough, more to our
fears than we to our gratitude.&nbsp; And it will be well if we are so
quickened by present calamity.</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Thus let us prepare ourselves to promote that condition of
feeling in the nation which shall lead us to meet God not in conflict but
in the way of his judgments, to bow to his rule, to abate our ungodliness,
and to become as a nation wise and understanding.</p>
<p>One remark as to the popular interpretation of the text.&nbsp; You will
have to meet God speedily in your death.&nbsp; You should prepare to meet
Him, for you cannot resist; you cannot flee from Him.&nbsp; Let us prepare
to meet Him by embracing the mercy which He offers, receiving the love
which He communicates to us, and devoting the rest of our lives to his
service and glory.&nbsp; You are called upon, then, and I think for these
reasons properly called upon, to contribute to and to promote the
humiliation of the nation.&nbsp; Whatever other people do, humble
yourselves before God.&nbsp; And let not the impression be a temporary one,
but in the future seek that practical love which constitutes the repentance
necessary to the nation, and necessary to you that you may prompt the
repentance and reformation of those about you, and which can alone save the
land of our fathers from calamity and make her more fully what she ought to
be, &ldquo;a praise in the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amen!</p>

119</span>THE PROPHETIC THEME.<br />
REV. GERVASE SMITH.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:
Searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in
them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ,
and the glory that should follow.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">Peter</span> i. 10, 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a peculiar interest attaching to the writer of this
epistle.&nbsp; Although it was probably in old age, when a large experience
of labour and sorrow had chastened his spirit, and in prospect of
martyrdom, that he composed these chapters, they bear unmistakable proofs
of his own vigour of thought, and suggest many reminiscences of his
remarkable life.&nbsp; Whether you regard him as a man, a Christian, or an
apostle, he presents an illustrious subject for the student of these modern
times.&nbsp; His history puts before us many and serious defects; but there
is <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>much more to approve and admire: and while a feeling or sorrow
lingers over the one, the other is so marked and prominent that it secures
your sympathy, and you are drawn towards the man with an ineffable
affection.&nbsp; There is a candour, and honesty, and generosity, and
heroism, which gives to his character a most healthy tone.&nbsp; The
qualities of his mind and heart, when sanctified by grace, become really
noble; and if it were right, you would like to forget his failings in
presence of so much that is both manly and good.</p>
<p>His two epistles are a precious legacy to the Church.&nbsp; The first is
addressed to the &ldquo;scattered strangers:&rdquo; but whether this
expression refer to Jews, or converted Gentiles, or both, or to the
&ldquo;dispersed&rdquo; of the ten tribes, there is no satisfactory
evidence.&nbsp; We are in similar doubt as to the place from which it was
written.&nbsp; The <i>Church at Babylon</i> is named in the last chapter;
but there was a Babylon in Egypt, and another in Assyria, and Rome itself
is thus figuratively designated.</p>
<p>The style of the apostle&rsquo;s writing is just what you would expect
from the man himself.&nbsp; Vehemence, majesty, and, at the same time, ease
and freedom, are manifest in every page.</p>
<p>The chief design of this epistle is to administer <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>comfort to those
already suffering; and to prepare others for the affliction they were about
to endure.&nbsp; The first chapter adduces several considerations to uphold
their constancy.&nbsp; One is that they are <i>the chosen of God</i>;
&ldquo;Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
Jesus Christ: grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
as the elect of God, they had a <i>good hope of heaven</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope,
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation,
ready to be revealed in the last time.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third consideration
is, that though in the midst of trial, their Saviour was with them, and the
end of their faith was sure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom having not seen, ye love; in
whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
unspeakable, and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the
salvation of your souls.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, finally, they were to remember
that this subject of their salvation had been matter of earnest enquiry
among the prophets, <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>whose labours are now made to contribute to
their comfort.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of which salvation the prophets have enquired
and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
you: searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was
in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ,
and the glory that should follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Student</span>, <span
class="smcap">and</span><br />
II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">His Theme</span>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The prophets have <i>enquired and searched
diligently</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; is most properly applied to one who is
divinely instructed as to future events, and divinely inspired to make them
known.&nbsp; In an accommodated sense it is given to the apostles and
public teachers of the primitive Church.&nbsp; And now it is conventionally
used to denote a somewhat less honourable class.&nbsp; &ldquo;The prophets
of our day&rdquo; are many.&nbsp; From the positive style they have
adopted, you would suppose that the gift of prescience had come upon them
in a far more absolute form than upon the prophets of old.&nbsp; With more
dogmatism and less authority do they pronounce upon &ldquo;the times and
seasons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though failure on failure happens, this seems rather
to nerve their confidence; and <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>every successive mistake is followed by
another guess with increased assurance.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Who are the prophets referred to in the text</i>?&nbsp; They
are the men to whom the term is strictly applicable.&nbsp; We do not forget
such names as Moses and Samuel, and Elijah and Elisha, and others; but
their prophecies are not given with the formality of those distinct books
to which perhaps St. Peter refers.&nbsp; In point of time Jonah comes just
with his message of woe to the city of Nineveh.&nbsp; Amos the herdman and
Hosea his contemporary follow.&nbsp; Then Joel with his thunder, and Isaiah
with his evangelism; Micah with his earnestness; Nahum with his sublimity;
and Zephaniah with his severity, take their place in about equal
succession.&nbsp; Jeremiah then appears with all his weightiness of matter
and solemnity of manner.&nbsp; Habakkuk in briefer form takes up the same
subjects.&nbsp; Daniel with great grandeur of style dwells on the topics of
the text.&nbsp; Obadiah stands between him and Ezekiel as though to make
them both more prominent.&nbsp; At a later period come Haggai and
Zechariah; and then Malachi closes the illustrious train, taking the last
pen from the wing of inspiration, or putting the signet upon the scroll of
prophecy.&nbsp; Some of these may be especially referred to; but we include
them all: for &ldquo;to Him give all the <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>prophets witness;
that in his name whosoever believeth in Him shall have forgiveness of
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; They were <i>men</i>; not angels, or belonging to some order
of being superior to ourselves; but they were members with us of the same
human family, and &ldquo;subject to like passions as we are.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They were <i>sinners</i>: born with the old taint of corruption; subject to
hereditary guilt, depravity, and death, and exposed to all the evils to
which flesh is heir.&nbsp; They were <i>redeemed sinners</i>, included in
that same covenant of mercy of which we make our boast.&nbsp; They were
therefore <i>personally interested</i> in those truths which became the
subject of their search.</p>
<p>The original promise belonged to them as well as to us.&nbsp; They
claimed an interest in the leading facts of patriarchal history, and in the
gorgeous ceremonial of the Mosaic Institute.&nbsp; All the events of divine
providence which were preparing the way for the Messiah&rsquo;s coming, and
the predictions which they themselves uttered, had some personal
bearing.&nbsp; They were not uninterested students of past history, of
present circumstances, or of future events.&nbsp; Their own destinies were
involved in the truths they taught.</p>
<p>(ii.)&nbsp; They were <i>good men</i>.&nbsp; That the Divine Being has
sometimes made &ldquo;false prophets&rdquo; means of carrying out his
purposes there can be <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>no doubt.&nbsp; But he is a daring man who
would venture from this either to justify or extenuate an impure
ministry.&nbsp; Sanctuary services are too pure and solemn to be performed
by any but &ldquo;<i>clean hands</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The instruments which
God ordains are holy.&nbsp; With a miserable exception here and there, even
the enemies of truth have not denied to the ancient prophets the crown of a
good character.&nbsp; Try them by any recognised standard of virtue, and
they will not be found wanting.&nbsp; Trace the minutest circumstances of
their private life; their self denial; their exposure to danger; their
fearlessness in denouncing sin; their being proof against corruption; their
zeal; their sympathy; their benevolence&mdash;and they present a startling
contrast with the priests of Paganism, or the false prophets among the
Jews.</p>
<p>Call to mind the meekness of Moses; the heroism of Elijah; the gratitude
of David; the sweetness of Hosea; the fervour of Isaiah; the tenderness of
Jeremiah; the constancy of Daniel; the faithfulness of Ezekiel&mdash;and
you unhesitatingly endorse the inspired oracle, that they were &ldquo;holy
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; And although some of the prophets are remarkable for
particular features of character, they are not wanting in all the others
which are requisite to constitute <i>goodness</i>.</p>
<p>But what a magnificent portrait could you <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>present to the mind
as you review the whole!&nbsp; The characteristics of these different men
meet and blend in the photograph; and you look upon a being&mdash;human it
is true, but sanctified by grace, and fitted to exercise &ldquo;a more
telling influence upon the destines of the world,&rdquo; than the mightiest
statesman, or the profoundest philosopher, or the noblest warrior of which
history can boast.&nbsp; Like the hues of the rainbow, which in all their
softness and sweetness and sublimity, rejoice to span the heavens together,
and make up one token of the covenant, do the prophets stand before us as
one class of men, unfolding the covenant of mercy, and offering light and
life to a dying and dark world.</p>
<p>(iii.)&nbsp; They were <i>inspired good men</i>.&nbsp; And here is
suggested one of the most formidable dangers of the present day.&nbsp; An
attempt is being made to dry up the most fruitful source of confidence
which the Christian has in the truth of his Bible:&mdash;viz., its plenary
inspiration.&nbsp; We know that this is not new; but the lover of
&ldquo;the Book&rdquo; had charmed himself with the hope that the
controversy was over, and the truth triumphant.&nbsp; He is now, however,
alarmed on finding that in addition to the old adversaries&mdash;the
infidel, the sceptic, and the profane&mdash;he has to enter the lists with
new combatants altogether; and among the <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>rest, the descendants
of those glorious Reformers, who, centuries ago, shook the papal power to
its centre; melted the Bible&rsquo;s chain in the martyr&rsquo;s flame; and
liberated the mind of a continent from the most crushing spiritual
despotism the world ever knew.&nbsp; It is a distressing sound to hear
those academic halls, which have been the greatness and the pride of
Germany, resounding with pernicious error, not to say, positive
blasphemy.&nbsp; Looking at the subject in the light of heaven we
gratefully and confidently say that &ldquo;the word of the Lord endureth
for ever;&rdquo; but humanly speaking, the Bible is in danger.&nbsp; And we
must be prepared to meet it with a zeal, &ldquo;such as in the
martyr&rsquo;s glowed, dying champions for their God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
plenary inspiration of the Scriptures, and therefore of the
prophets&mdash;is our impregnable stronghold, and must never be
abandoned.&nbsp; The apostle says, when referring to the Old
Testament&mdash;&ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness.&nbsp; For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of
man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; And by this inspiration we do not merely mean that some
general ideas were poured into their minds, which they clothed in their own
language, and then published <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>them to the world as a revelation from
heaven.&nbsp; If the Bible be inspired <i>at all</i>, it is <i>fully</i>
inspired.&nbsp; Otherwise, you cannot tell where to make the distinction
between what is divine and what is human.&nbsp; You must either maintain
the truth of the <i>whole</i> book, or abandon your conviction of its
supreme authority.&nbsp; We adopt the statement that the prophets
&ldquo;composed their works under so plenary and immediate an influence of
the Holy Spirit that God may be said to speak by them to man, and not
merely that they spoke to men in the name of God, and by his
authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark the wide distinction which is here
suggested.&nbsp; Take the case of an earnest and trustworthy
minister.&nbsp; He tells his congregation that he is anxious to give them
the truth; and has been to God in his closet asking for light.&nbsp; In
answer to prayer he believes that the Holy Spirit has given him light; and,
confident that it is the truth, he announces it to the people.&nbsp; But
you would not say that that man is inspired.&nbsp; There may be much of
what is fallible and human with what is truthful and divine.&nbsp; Suppose,
however, that on some Sabbath morning, he could with authority stand up and
say that what is now about to be declared is not his, but
God&rsquo;s&mdash;that he is in ignorance of what the utterance will really
be, and that in simple fact, God is to speak through <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>him, using his lips
only as the medium of communication; you have here an instance of what is
meant by plenary inspiration.&nbsp; And this we say is the case with the
prophets.&nbsp; These &ldquo;holy men of God spake <i>as</i> they were
moved by the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Not in the <i>words</i> which man&rsquo;s
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Their Conduct</i>.&nbsp; They &ldquo;enquired and searched
diligently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; What is implied in the <i>search</i> they made?&nbsp; It
would seem as if for the moment the thought of their inspiration was
dropped; and like other earnest students of the Bible, they now search to
ascertain the meaning of their own, and each other&rsquo;s
prophecies.&nbsp; There is here, however, an incidental, though strong
proof of the justice of their claims.&nbsp; The predictions they uttered
were not their own conceptions; not the product of their own reasoning; and
perhaps not even engraven on their own memory.&nbsp; They gave expression
to statements beyond themselves, and the meaning of which at the time, they
did not understand.&nbsp; And when (if we may so say) the breath of
inspiration had passed from them, they sat down to discover by diligent
search the import of those utterances which they had made.&nbsp; They had
<i>written</i> for <i>the world</i>: they now <i>enquired</i> for
<i>themselves</i>.&nbsp; Their <i>predictions</i> are by <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>the grace of God, the
property of the Church: their <i>search</i> is for their own personal
benefit.&nbsp; The truths they proclaim, become the power of God to their
own comfort and purity.</p>
<p>The metaphor is taken from the employment of a miner who digs deeply
into the caverns of the earth that he may find its treasures; and by their
appropriation enrich himself.&nbsp; The prophets were not satisfied with
the mere knowledge of the fact that the mine existed, and that its contents
were more brilliant than any of Golconda, and beyond the price of
rubies.&nbsp; They went to dig for themselves; and seizing the precious
pearls of truth, they enriched and beautified and ennobled their own
character, until their shining became too glorious for earth: they were
then translated to heaven to sparkle amid eternal sunshine, and burn in
glory for ever.&nbsp; How solemnly does the Great Teacher&rsquo;s
injunction sound in our ears&mdash;&ldquo;Search the Scriptures; for in
them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of
Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(ii.)&nbsp; The <i>earnestness</i> of their search.&nbsp; They
&ldquo;enquired and searched <i>diligently</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This word is
forceful and signifies to trace out or explore thoroughly.&nbsp; The idea
which the apostle intends to convey is thought to be this: &ldquo;they
perceived that in their communications there were so <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>great and glorious
truths which they did not fully comprehend, and they diligently employed
their natural faculties to understand that which they were appointed to
impart to succeeding generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is much of simplicity
and power in the account which Daniel gives of his own <i>search</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the first year of&rdquo; the reign &ldquo;of
Darius&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I (Daniel) <i>understood by books</i> the number
of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, the prophet,
that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; And I <i>set my face</i> (marking earnestness and
diligence and resolve) unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and
supplication&rdquo; the meaning of these things.&nbsp; You are not
surprised at the visit of the man Gabriel, who was caused to fly swiftly;
and, touching him at the time of the evening oblation, said, &ldquo;O
Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.&nbsp; I
will show thee that which is noted in the Scriptures of truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, if the prophets had thus with earnest diligence to search out the
meaning of their own predictions, what but our capacity should be the
measure of our toil?&nbsp; Nor is this labour to be confined to the
pulpit.&nbsp; &ldquo;The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you want to know the meaning of your Bible, you must
<!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>prayerfully study it.&nbsp; &ldquo;These in Berea were more noble
than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things
were so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here then is our Student: himself a study for all who are anxious to
comprehend this book.&nbsp; There are only three orders of being by whom
God has spoken to the world: Christ; the angels; and <i>men</i>.&nbsp; And
among these men the prophets hold the first rank.&nbsp; At an early
period&mdash;the elements of religion being already revealed&mdash;a new
method of communicating truth was employed; and man rose from the position
of an <i>observer</i>, to the dignity and majesty of the prophet.&nbsp; In
some instances he is removed at once into this office without previous
training.&nbsp; But generally God walks among &ldquo;the schools of the
prophets;&rdquo; and laying his hand upon the chosen one, He bids him go
forth.&nbsp; His very call seems to constitute him an extraordinary
man.&nbsp; Both his appearance and actions make him singular.&nbsp; He
stands alone.&nbsp; The mountain or the sequestered vale is his abode; and
he is only seen among men when he has some message from God.&nbsp; Clothed
in his sackcloth, he appears at the court, the city, and the village; and
having pronounced the coming woe, or stated the imposed duty, or <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>offered
pardon, he mysteriously disappears; and is seen no more, till the burden is
again upon him, and forces him to come forth and speak.&nbsp; There is a
fire in his eye, but it is inspiration, not wildness.&nbsp; There is a
majesty in his gait, as though he is either great himself, or is employed
by one who is.&nbsp; There is a solemnity of countenance and a nobility of
manner, which say that he is not often among mortals, but dwells in a
higher sphere.&nbsp; In language which more fully pertains to us as
Christians, his &ldquo;conversation is in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carried up
by the Spirit perhaps to the summit of the mountain which covers his
retreat, views of the future break upon his vision.&nbsp; His eye burns;
his lips quiver; his bosom heaves.&nbsp; And opening his mouth, he pours
forth in more than angelic cadences, the designs of God concerning men, and
kingdoms, and the human race.&nbsp; It may be that to himself all this is a
mystery.&nbsp; He therefore gathers up every utterance, and carries them to
his mountain home.&nbsp; In that consecrated cave he spreads out the
panorama; and lifting up his eyes to heaven for light, he traces the
picture to see what &ldquo;the Spirit of Christ which was in&rdquo; him
&ldquo;did signify.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet is the harp of prophecy; too sweet<br />
Not to be wronged by a mere mortal touch,<br />
Nor can the wonders it records be sung<br />
To meaner music, and not suffer loss.&rdquo;</p>

134</span>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Theme</span>.&mdash;It is here
presented in a twofold aspect.&nbsp; First, in its <i>entirety</i>: and
secondly, in one of its <i>branches</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The great subject of prophetic enquiry is
<i>salvation</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of which <i>salvation</i> the prophets have
enquired and searched diligently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; In its <i>nature</i>.&nbsp; Is there a word in universal
language which has as much meaning in it as this word salvation?&nbsp; It
takes within its range all time and all eternity.&nbsp; Though specially
designed for man, it has its influence upon every order of being God has
made, and presents the most glorious manifestations of God himself which
the world possesses.&nbsp; It glares upon sin with indignation, but throws
its arms of mercy around the sinner; offers to him a deliverance from the
guilt and power and pollution and inbeing of evil; gives him the favour and
image of his Maker; assures to him victory over his final adversary;
introduces him to, and acquits him before the great white throne; and
arrays him in all the glories of an everlasting heaven.</p>
<p>To understand it fully comes not within the range of angelic intellect;
and yet it demands our highest regard, as it has had the attention of
enquiring prophets.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true they had not the light upon it
that a better dispensation has given to us.&nbsp; It is not to be expected
that they should <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>be penetrated with its glory as we ought to
be; but they were so impressed by its grandeur, that their thoughts were
raised above all merely temporal deliverances, and they felt that their own
interests were wrapped up in the theme.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; we
are told, &ldquo;did this sweet stream of their doctrine, as the rivers,
make its own banks fertile and pleasant as it ran by, and flowed still
forward to after ages; and by the confluence of more such prophecies, grew
greater as it went, till it fell in with the main current of the gospel in
the New Testament both acted and preached by the Great Prophet himself whom
they foretold as to come, and recorded by his apostles and evangelists, and
thus united into one river clear as crystal.&nbsp; This doctrine of
salvation in the Scriptures hath refreshed the city of God, his Church
under the gospel, and still shall do so till it empty itself into the ocean
of eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(ii.)&nbsp; This salvation <i>in its provision</i>, is <i>of
grace</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who prophesied <i>of the grace</i> that should come
unto you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The apostle does not mean to say by this clause,
that there is something in the theme <i>exclusively</i> adapted to those to
whom he wrote.&nbsp; But we understand him to mean, in general terms, that
the ancient seers searched diligently into that system of mercy, which
should in after times, and under the Christian dispensation, be more fully
revealed.</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>The word &ldquo;grace&rdquo; may have reference to <i>the
manner</i> in which this scheme should be made known; intimating that it
was by <i>divine favour</i> that the new economy supervened upon the
old.&nbsp; But we take it rather to denote <i>the gospel salvation
itself</i>.&nbsp; It is altogether a system of grace.&nbsp; In its
projection; in its development; in its accomplishment; in its application;
in its final consummation, it is all of grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;By grace ye are
saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are not among the number of those who doubt or deny the entire and
absolute fall of man.&nbsp; Whatever good there was in him was then
destroyed; whatever evil there is in him, was then induced.&nbsp; He is
fallen in mind and soul and body.&nbsp; Physically, morally, spiritually,
he is a wreck.&nbsp; But was no vestage left of that divine image in which
he was created?&nbsp; Not one.&nbsp; No lingering desire to regain his
glory and the position he had lost?&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Was he altogether
dead to virtue and his Maker&rsquo;s claims?&nbsp; Yes, altogether.&nbsp;
But was his nature so far polluted as that no trace of his original purity
could be discovered?&nbsp; Not a trace to be seen even by an Omniscient
eye.&nbsp; And was there left to him <i>no</i> inherent power to do that
which is good?&nbsp; None whatever.&nbsp; &ldquo;From the sole of the foot
even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises,
and putrifying sores: they have not <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>been closed, neither
bound up, neither mollified with ointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then see his position.&nbsp; If his fall, which is so entire, is his own
act, he is as much amenable to his Maker as he was before.&nbsp; The fact
of his fall will not lesson his obligations: nor will it impose upon God
any necessity to show mercy.&nbsp; He therefore stands before his Judge a
condemned criminal; and the course which the Judge shall take is entirely
within himself.&nbsp; There is nothing which can force Him to show
favour.&nbsp; If He say, die, He is as justly glorious as He was
before.&nbsp; If then, there is <i>no</i> obligation upon God to save: and
if He <i>does</i> determine to be gracious, the salvation <i>must be</i> of
grace.&nbsp; Oh, is it possible to conceive the solemnity of that moment
when the destinies of untold millions were in the balance?&nbsp; Can you
picture the suspense of heaven and hell when waiting Jehovah&rsquo;s
fiat?&nbsp; Surely for the moment the pulse of nature throbbed not;
heaven&rsquo;s music ceased to flow, and the howl of the pit was
hushed.&nbsp; Then God, on his azure throne, holding in one hand the sword,
and in the other the sceptre, stretched out the sceptre saying,
&ldquo;Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a
ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your salvation is of grace.&nbsp; You are required to <i>pray</i>; but
you are saved by grace.&nbsp; You are <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>required to
<i>believe</i>; but you are saved by grace.&nbsp; You are required to
<i>labour</i>; but you are saved by grace.&nbsp; You are required to
<i>suffer</i>; but you are saved by grace.&nbsp; You will have to
<i>die</i>; but when you stand a spirit glorified before the throne, it
will be by grace.</p>
<p>(iii.)&nbsp; Salvation in <i>its object</i> is the soul.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your
<i>souls</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the soul we understand the immaterial
principle or spiritual part of man; which though united with the body, is
perfectly distinct from it.</p>
<p>As to its <i>nature</i>, it is possessed of intelligence, volition,
sensation.&nbsp; It has capacities for enjoyment and suffering: for both
good and evil.&nbsp; Its <i>immortality</i> is assured to us by the mouth
of God.&nbsp; It may be lost.&nbsp; With all its dignity and glory, it may
be for ever crushed by the divine hand, but never destroyed.&nbsp; While,
however, it may be lost, it may be saved.&nbsp; The grace which can calm
its fears, and satisfy its hopes, and purge its impurity, and consummate
its bliss is now manifested.&nbsp; How insignificant does everything appear
when compared with <i>its</i> salvation.&nbsp; The blotting of the sun, the
desolation of an universe is a trifle when put in the balance with an
immortal spirit.&nbsp; Let the sceptic doubt its immortality, and the
atheist deny, and the scoffer jest; but let us <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>look forward to the
judgment-seat and beyond it, for &ldquo;the soul, immortal as its sire,
shall never die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(iv.)&nbsp; Salvation, <i>in its attainment</i>, is <i>by
faith</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The end of your faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no article of our religion more plainly revealed than
this&mdash;&ldquo;By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God.&nbsp; Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shalt be saved.&nbsp; Whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish,
but hath eternal life.&nbsp; He that believeth shall be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Faith is the simplest operation of the mind; and may therefore strictly be
said to be incapable of definition.&nbsp; Still it is easy to say what is
meant by the term when applied to personal salvation.&nbsp; It means the
trust of the heart on the atonement of Christ, as the condition of
pardon.&nbsp; &ldquo;With the heart man believeth unto
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is however of the highest importance that
the thought of its <i>simplicity</i> be made prominent.&nbsp; Let us not
undervalue religious knowledge; for to some extent it is absolutely
necessary.&nbsp; But do not mystify the plan of mercy, and perplex the
anxious seeker by requirements which the gospel has not made
prominent.&nbsp; Many a poor sinner exercises faith in Christ who cannot
give a <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>philosophical disquisition as to its nature.&nbsp; It is not
necessary to be thoroughly acquainted with the science of optics in order
to see.&nbsp; A man may look through a telescope before he can define the
refraction or reflection of light.&nbsp; Now all that is included in the
word salvation hangs on this simple condition.</p>
<p>The question may be regarded perhaps more nice than wise as to
<i>why</i> such a condition should have been appointed; and yet it will
sometimes force itself upon the thoughtful mind.&nbsp; The answer to it
must in great measure be conjectural, but may we not suppose that
<i>one</i> design of it was to do away with the last vestige of
self-righteousness in man?&nbsp; If Moses had struck the rock with
something more powerful than the little rod, the gushing of the waters
might have been attributed to his own strength.&nbsp; If Jericho had been
taken by a regular siege, the glory of its conquest would have been
ascribed to military science and the prowess of arms.&nbsp; If some heavy
conditions had been imposed upon the sinner, he would have <i>claimed</i>
his pardon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But, &lsquo;how unlike the complex works of man,<br />
Heaven&rsquo;s easy, artless, unencumbered plan,<br />
No meretricious graces to beguile,<br />
No clustering ornaments to clay the pile.<br />
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>From ostentation as from weakness free,<br />
It stands like the cerulean arch we see,<br />
Majestic in its own simplicity.<br />
Inscribed above the portal from afar,<br />
Conspicuous as the brightness of a star,<br />
Legible only by the light they give,<br />
Stand the soul-quickening words&mdash;Believe and Live.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp; The apostle next concentrates attention upon one leading
<i>branch</i> of this great theme.</p>
<p>Having put the whole subject before us in the word salvation, he now
fixes our thought upon <i>the relation which Christ sustains to
it</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of
Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
testimony which is here said to be borne to Christ, is by the Spirit, and
the signification of the Spirit in the testimony is that which the prophets
sought.&nbsp; He who in the text is called &ldquo;the Spirit of
Christ,&rdquo; in the following verse is designated the Holy Ghost, so that
there can be no doubt as to the person referred to.&nbsp; He is variously
spoken of as &ldquo;the Spirit of God&rdquo;&mdash;&rdquo;the Spirit of the
Father&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the Spirit of the Son&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the
Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and He is the third person in the Holy Trinity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the entire and undivided unity of the Godhead, there is a Trinity
of personal subsistences; <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>consubstantial, co-equal, and
co-eternal.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was this &ldquo;Spirit of Christ&rdquo; who
inspired the prophets; for these &ldquo;holy men of God spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; They sought the signification of the Spirit as to the
<i>Saviour&rsquo;s person</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Searching
<i>what</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This expression is said to mean either what
<i>time</i>; or what <i>people</i>; or what <i>person</i>.&nbsp; But
looking at the whole passage it seems most naturally to refer to Him who is
the subject of these predictions.&nbsp; They therefore diligently enquired
as to who He was, of whom they, under inspiration, had been speaking.</p>
<p>(ii.)&nbsp; They also studied the prophecies as <i>to the time of his
coming</i>: &ldquo;What manner of time?&rdquo;&nbsp; This phrase has a
twofold application.&nbsp; It may refer to that particular period of the
world&rsquo;s history when the Saviour should come to endure his sufferings
and enter into his glory.&nbsp; So Daniel reckoned up the number of the
weeks, and sought to understand the time.</p>
<p>It may also have reference to &ldquo;the character and condition of the
age&rdquo; when He should become incarnate.&nbsp; &ldquo;What <i>manner</i>
of time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are now brought to the testimony itself which the Spirit beforehand
gave.</p>
<p>(iii.)&nbsp; <i>The Saviour&rsquo;s sufferings</i>, in their relation to
our salvation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sufferings of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>We limit ourselves to two thoughts: these sufferings <i>were
predicted</i>, and those predictions <i>were fulfilled</i>.&nbsp; Nearly
the whole of the Old Testament has a connection with them.&nbsp; They are
predicted by the very page which records the fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I will
put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed:
it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Under the patriarchal economy there was a significant allusion to them in
the offering up of Isaac.&nbsp; The Mosaic types were prophecies.&nbsp; The
paschal lamb; the smitten rock; the brazen serpent; and the scape-goat on
the day of expiation, exhibited this feature of Messiah&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; Well nigh every page of the prophets is marked by blood
and sorrow.&nbsp; The Psalmist, in thrilling tone, enquires, &ldquo;My God,
my God why hast thou forsaken Me?&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the last struggles of
death Jesus quoted the passage in its application to himself.&nbsp; The
fifty-third chapter of Isaiah is an unapproachable description of a
suffering person.&nbsp; Its reference to Christ has been extorted from the
Jew, and is confidently believed by every Christian.&nbsp; The notion of
two Messiahs&mdash;the one suffering and the other conquering&mdash;is an
unworthy subterfuge, and stands opposed to both fact and Scripture.&nbsp;
Daniel is second only to Isaiah in his minute and <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>powerful description
of the Redeemer&rsquo;s sufferings.&nbsp; Zechariah almost closes the book
by the startling cry, &ldquo;Awake, O sword, against my Shepherd, and
against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the
Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn mine hand upon
the little ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That these Scriptures have been fulfilled who can doubt that believes
the gospels?&nbsp; Just before the Saviour&rsquo;s ascension, and while yet
partaking of the valedictory feast with his disciples, &ldquo;He said unto
them, these are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you,
that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses,
and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning Me.&nbsp; Then opened He
their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures, and said
unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to
rise from the dead the third day.&rdquo;&nbsp; We pass by the pain and
hunger and thirst which are the attributes of humanity; but from his very
incarnation may it be said that his sufferings began.&nbsp; Mark the
meanness of his birth; the poverty of his circumstances; the persecution
which drove Him from his infant-home, and think of his manner of life prior
to the public announcement of his character, and you say with the <!-- page
145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>prophet&mdash;&ldquo;A man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now look into Gethsemane&rsquo;s innermost recess and you see an amount
of suffering unendurable except under heavenly strengthening; &ldquo;And,
being in an agony, He prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were
great drops of blood falling down to the ground.&nbsp; And there appeared
an angel unto Him from heaven, strengthening Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Betrayed by
a disciple, He is apprehended by the &ldquo;multitude with swords and
staves:&rdquo; then arraigned before the high priest; then before Pilate:
then taken before Herod and clothed in the purple; then bound and dragged
again before Pilate: then smitten by the ruffianly attendants, and forsaken
by his followers He is condemned to die.&nbsp; After the Roman fashion He
is led away bearing his own cross to the fated hill.&nbsp; Here is the
consummation of their cruelty, of his suffering, and of heaven&rsquo;s
suspense.&nbsp; The leader of an army to the battle-field looks with
anxiety to that moment of the day which decides the conflict; and either
covers him with a nation&rsquo;s glory, or overwhelms him in a
nation&rsquo;s disgrace.&nbsp; The fate of empires has hung on the actions
of an hour; and the liberties of a continent have trembled for an instant
in the balance.&nbsp; But the salvation of a world was hanging on <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Calvary till
the Sufferer exclaimed: &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will not suppose that we have exhibited all, or even a principal
part of &ldquo;the sufferings of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not wish to
underrate this bodily distress; but oh, compare it not with the depth of
the soul&rsquo;s agony.&nbsp; The hand of man which smote Him was malignant
and painful too; but the hand of God with the sword of justice in it, fell
in dreadful weight and pierced his spirit.&nbsp; His being betrayed and
forsaken by the disciples was a source of pain; but it was when the Father
hid his face that his sufferings were complete.&nbsp; &ldquo;My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the general scope of prophecy, there are many minute and
particular predictions of suffering which were fulfilled.&nbsp; The
Psalmist says&mdash;&ldquo;Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted,
which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And you call to mind the betrayal of our Saviour.&nbsp; David says again,
&ldquo;They pierced my hands and my feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when He was
crucified the nails were driven through these parts of the body.&nbsp;
Isaiah says, &ldquo;He was numbered with the transgressors;&rdquo; and we
know that He was crucified between two thieves.&nbsp; Prophecy says,
&ldquo;They part my garments <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>among them, and casts lots upon my
vesture.&rdquo;&nbsp; History says, &ldquo;And they crucified Him, and
parted his garments casting lots.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prophecy says, &ldquo;A bone
of Him shall not be broken.&rdquo;&nbsp; History says that when the
soldiers &ldquo;came to Jesus and saw that He was dead already, they brake
not his legs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prophecy says, &ldquo;They gave me also gall for
my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&rdquo;&nbsp;
History says, &ldquo;They gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with
gall,&rdquo; when He said &ldquo;I thirst.&rdquo;&nbsp; You are not
surprised then, that after the fulfilment of so many and varied
predictions, Jesus should have spoken to the two doubting disciples with a
somewhat sterner voice than was his wont: &ldquo;O fools, and slow of heart
to believe all that the prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have
suffered these things, and to enter into his glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(iv.)&nbsp; See the connection between this salvation and the Saviour,
with regard to <i>the glory</i> resulting from his passion and death.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the glory,&rdquo; or glories, &ldquo;that should
follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; We distract not your mind with the many meanings of
the word &ldquo;<i>glory</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the text it signifies the
honour accruing to the Redeemer himself, and the benefit resulting to the
world from his sufferings.&nbsp; It will apply to <i>his resurrection</i>;
for even <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>of this the prophets had some knowledge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou wilt
not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has also reference to the Saviour&rsquo;s
<i>exaltation to</i> and <i>session at the right hand of the Father</i>:
for this is the result of his humiliation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We see Jesus, who
was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned
with glory and honour; that He by the grace of God should taste death for
every man.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it has another meaning.&nbsp; The glory
resulting from &ldquo;the sufferings of Christ,&rdquo; is to be seen in
<i>the carrying out of his own scheme of mercy</i>, and <i>the universal
happiness of man</i>.&nbsp; Nothing short of this can satisfy the scope of
the text; the expectation and claims of the Messiah; or the call of the
Church.&nbsp; It was no less an object than this&mdash;the saving of a
whole world&mdash;that brought Christ from heaven and raised up the Church
on earth.&nbsp; If you look or labour for anything short of this, you
degrade your Master and dishonour yourselves.&nbsp; You have got too large
a machinery at work for anything less than this.&nbsp; You will cripple the
energies and damp the ardour of our Captain&rsquo;s embattled hosts, if you
are satisfied with anything short of the conquest of a world.&nbsp; The
question therefore is, have we any fair prospect of, and guarantee for,
universal glory?</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>The text itself affords ground of hope that in the Scriptures we
shall find all we desire.&nbsp; An intimation is given that the prophets
themselves not only predicted it, but by their diligent search, apprehended
and believed it.&nbsp; And let us not suppose that our faith in a happy
world rests on a few dark or obscure expressions thinly scattered over the
Bible, and requiring more than ordinary penetration to find them at
all.&nbsp; Science by gigantic strides seems almost to have reached its
perfection.&nbsp; We are told that by its light the philosopher can, from a
single bone put into his hands, discover the existence of a &ldquo;great
wingless bird&rdquo; of another hemisphere, and can construct &ldquo;its
skeleton so exactly, that when all the bones&rdquo; arrive in this country
&ldquo;the correspondence between them and their conjectural
portraits&rdquo; is complete; that the astronomer is able by his
calculations to tell the existence of a planet, which observation proves to
be strictly true.&nbsp; But wonderful as is all this, we are not reduced to
any such necessity with regard to the future of the gospel.&nbsp; We have
not to take a few dark sayings, or enigmatical expressions, or hieroglyphic
inscriptions, and as we best may spell out the universal spread of
truth.&nbsp; As with the light of a sunbeam, or with &ldquo;the point of a
diamond,&rdquo; is it revealed.&nbsp; <!-- page 150--><a

read.&nbsp; Abraham saw it: &ldquo;And in thy seed shall all the families
of the earth be blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jacob saw it: &ldquo;The sceptre
shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until
Shiloh come; and unto Him shall the gathering of the people
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; David saw it: &ldquo;Ask of Me, and I will give thee the
heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
possession.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isaiah saw it: &ldquo;The wolf also shall dwell
with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf,
and the young lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh what a state of security and peace!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather
themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and
thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the Church no
more hang down her head with grief.&nbsp; Look up, and see what is
approaching.&nbsp; &ldquo;All they gather themselves together, they come to
thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at
thy side.&rdquo;&nbsp; A general confluence of the nations is at hand, and
all will flow into the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then thou shalt see, and flow
together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the
abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of <!-- page

shall come unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vast-swelling multitude with their
wealth shall come and beg admission.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have now to beg people
to come into the church: the day is coming when they shall ask
permission.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the
doves to their windows?&rdquo;&nbsp; Who <i>are</i> these myriads making
their way to Christ?&nbsp; &ldquo;And as the doves to their
windows?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a storm at hand: the people foresee it, and
run for refuge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy gates shall be open continually; they
shall not be shut day or night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of
the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.&rdquo;&nbsp; So constant
is the pouring in that the doors must be kept open.&nbsp; It is now a rare
thing to see a convert approaching; but then the stream will be continuous,
and the houses of prayer open night and day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the
breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy
Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.&rdquo;&nbsp; The very wealth which is
now in heathen hands shall be consecrated to the further spread of the
gospel.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thou shalt suck the breast of kings:&rdquo; for
they shall become &ldquo;nursing fathers and queens nursing mothers;&rdquo;
and the reign of the Messiah shall be one of peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Violence
shall <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.&nbsp; Thy sun shall no
more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be
thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.&nbsp;
Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for
ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be
glorified.&nbsp; A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a
strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do not
say that this glorious chapter is exceptional.&nbsp; It is only a sample,
and the bulk is equal in beauty.&nbsp; If the Bible, then, be true, a
redeemed universe is hastening upon us.&nbsp; Paradise created even cannot
put before us the glory of paradise restored.&nbsp; All the events which
are passing over us&mdash;even those which appear the most
alarming&mdash;are under an influence which will make them tributary to the
final issue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who
only doeth wondrous things, and blessed be his glorious name for ever; and
let the whole earth be filled with his glory.&nbsp; Amen and
Amen.&rdquo;</p>

Scriptures</i>.&nbsp; Unless it be the great doctrine of atonement, there
is no truth to which the Christian clings, assailed with greater bitterness
in our days than the plenary authority of the Bible.&nbsp; Moreover the low
views on this question which many professing Christians hold and teach, are
most deplorable and damaging.&nbsp; We expect opposition from the avowed
adversaries of the Book; but, the source of truth is now imperilled by
indifference and treachery.&nbsp; The whole volume has a divine
origin.&nbsp; &ldquo;God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in
times past by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his
Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A lesson of <i>love to the Saviour</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath
died&rdquo; for us, &ldquo;the just for the unjust, that He might bring us
to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do not forget your personal interest in those
sufferings to which the text refers.&nbsp; They are in the strictest sense
<i>vicarious</i>.&nbsp; He suffered not for his own sins, but for
yours.&nbsp; You may realise their saving efficacy, and be &ldquo;made meet
for the inheritance of the saints in light.&rdquo;&nbsp; How great are his
claims upon our affection and service!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; A lesson of <i>duty to the world</i>.&nbsp; The salvation of
the whole race is provided by &ldquo;the sufferings;&rdquo; and is included
in &ldquo;the glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; A sanctified <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>universe is to be the
result of the Saviour&rsquo;s cross: and to a large extent He has made the
Churches responsible for the conversion of the world.&nbsp; A weight of
obligation rests upon each member which cannot be put into language.&nbsp;
The wailings of a dying race call loudly for our zeal.&nbsp; The groans of
the lost gather strength as they ascend the pit.&nbsp; The voice of heaven,
from angels, saints, and God, urge us onward in the discharge of
duty.&nbsp; Oh, the wreck is on the billow; hasten with the means of
safety.&nbsp; The plague-spot is in the camp; offer the incense of
atonement.&nbsp; And let all your efforts be put forth in faith, and under
a deep impression of the truth of Cecil&rsquo;s memorable words:
&ldquo;Faith is the master-spring of a Minister,&rdquo; as well as of every
Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hell is before me, and thousands of lost souls are
shut up there in everlasting agony.&nbsp; Jesus Christ stands forth to save
men from rushing into this bottomless abyss.&nbsp; He sends me to proclaim
His ability and love.&nbsp; I want no fourth idea.&rdquo;</p>

155</span>THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST JESUS.<br />
REV. GEORGE WOOD.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Philippians</span> ii. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Saviour left His followers an example that they should tread in His
steps; and His example in everything that appertains to His human nature,
is not only practicable but essential.&nbsp; We cannot imitate His power,
or His wisdom, or His miracles, or His sufferings, or anything in which His
Divine nature was manifested or employed; but we can imitate His meekness,
His patience, His zeal, His self-denial, His superiority to temptation, His
abandonment of the world, His devotion to His Father&rsquo;s will, in
short, all those habits of mind and life which distinguished His earthly
career.&nbsp; And with this <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>perfect example before us, we need never be in
doubt or perplexity as to what is our duty; we may test our motives and our
conduct by the teaching and example of Christ, and if we possess His mind
we shall endeavour to copy His life&mdash;to &ldquo;walk as Christ also
walked&rdquo;&mdash;to be in this world as Christ also was.</p>
<p>This Epistle was addressed by the Apostle Paul to a Church which he
tenderly loved, and for whose prosperity he constantly prayed.&nbsp; He had
suffered much in the establishment of Christianity at Philippi, and the
Philippians had suffered much in the maintenance of their profession of
faith, chiefly from their fellow-citizens who continued heathen.&nbsp; The
Apostle was a prisoner at Rome, with the prospect of martyrdom as the
termination of his glorious career.&nbsp; Undaunted by the prospect, he
declares his readiness&mdash;nay, more&mdash;his &ldquo;desire to depart
and be with Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; He exhorts the Philippians to
steadfastness, fidelity, and patience amid the sufferings to which they
were exposed from without; and to simplicity and &ldquo;lowliness of
mind&rdquo; amongst themselves.&nbsp; He sets before them the conduct of
Christ in His condescension, and the glory of Christ in His exaltation; and
exhorts them to imitate the Saviour&rsquo;s humility, that they might share
His triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let this <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>mind be in you, which
was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This text is of universal application.&nbsp; It applies to us.&nbsp; The
highest dignity attainable in this world is conformity to Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; In what then does conformity to Jesus Christ consist?&nbsp;
In other words, what are those elements of character and conduct which
distinguished Him, and which are to be copied by us in our daily life?</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The first which we mention, and which is prominent throughout
the whole of His history is <i>meekness</i> or <i>humility</i>.&nbsp;
Dignified as was His character, high as were His claims, glorious as was
His mission, He was never arrogant or boastful, proud or
ostentatious.&nbsp; He neither sought the homage of the multitude, nor the
society of the rich and the great.&nbsp; He accepted these if offered, but
He never sought them.&nbsp; It is a fact that Christ never demanded, yet
never declined the worship of men during His earthly sojourn.&nbsp; The
Apostles shrunk from it, Angels rebuked it when offered to them, Christ
never did.&nbsp; It was sometimes given, it was never declined.&nbsp; He
did not obtrude Himself upon the attention of the multitude as the Saviour
of the world; but ate, and drank, and slept, and walked, and lived amongst
them, and was in <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>every respect a man with men.&nbsp; He
sometimes escaped from the society of the rich, that He might mitigate the
sorrows, and promote the interests of the poor.&nbsp; He never sought human
applause, and frequently retired from the scene of the most astounding
miracle, charging the subject of His healing and His blessing to
&ldquo;tell no man&rdquo; of Him.&nbsp; He might have taken the throne, and
reigned &ldquo;King of the Jews,&rdquo; in a political and worldly sense,
had He been covetous of regal honours, or ambitious for worldly
power.&nbsp; But He had a higher mission.&nbsp; His kingdom was &ldquo;not
of this world,&rdquo; and He came &ldquo;not to be ministered unto, but to
minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cannot, however, be asserted that Jesus was insensible, or altogether
indifferent, to the temptations to popularity and power to which He was
exposed; if so, His example is of no practical utility to us.&nbsp; He did
not feel as we feel, and we can gather no instruction, and no motives from
His history or experience.&nbsp; But we believe that He &ldquo;was in all
points tempted <i>like</i> as we are;&rdquo; that as a man He was the
subject of all the emotions, affections, and impulses which we feel.&nbsp;
He could weep, and love, and hate, and fear, and pure as His nature was, He
had to battle with the various temptations of the world and the wicked one,
all the more perhaps because of the sinlessness of His holy humanity.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Great and frequent were the provocations of His enemies, but He
never lost His temper&mdash;He never forfeited the claim to be called
&ldquo;the meek and lowly Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you follow Him to the
house of Caiaphas the high priest, to the judgment hall of Herod or of
Pilate, or to the Cross itself&mdash;though He was buffetted, accused
falsely, condemned, spit upon, crucified&mdash;He passed through all the
same calm, humble, holy Being.&nbsp; There was no retaliation, no
resentment.&nbsp; There was majesty in His very meekness.&nbsp; And this is
an important element in the Saviour&rsquo;s character and conduct, which as
Christians we must acquire and exhibit.</p>
<p>Undue elevation in circumstances of prosperity and fame, is as injurious
to our spiritual progress, as irritation and depression are in
circumstances of adversity and trial; and both are to be avoided.&nbsp; The
Saviour left us an example&mdash;a bright and a beautiful example&mdash;O
how few of us copy it in this respect.&nbsp; When the voice of flattery and
praise is heard&mdash;when we are raised to posts of influence and
honour&mdash;when the sun shines brightly upon our daily pathway&mdash;how
few of us keep our meekness and humility; how few of us carry all our
honours back to Him who gave them; how few of us so improve and sanctify
our talents as that He shall have the glory.&nbsp; And on <!-- page
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the other
hand when fortune frowns upon us&mdash;when the world despises
us&mdash;when our &ldquo;own familiar friend, in whom we trusted, lifteth
up his heel against us,&rdquo; alas! how few of us &ldquo;calmly sit on
tumult&rsquo;s wheel,&rdquo; and leave events to God.&nbsp; It is easier to
sing and preach about such a disposition than it is to acquire and exhibit
it; but it is attainable and it is essential&mdash;&ldquo;Let this mind be
in you which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <i>Simplicity</i> and <i>unity</i> distinguish the character
and conduct of Christ.&nbsp; In all His intercourse with friends and foes,
His adherence to truth and righteousness is marked and constant.&nbsp; He
was criticised and catechised and calumniated, but His transparency of
character was never destroyed.&nbsp; His enemies opposed and threatened,
but He never hesitated in the path of duty, or in His devotion to His
Father&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; However captious their questions, and whether
they related to political or spiritual matters, He invariably turned them
against His opponents, and made them minister to the cause of truth and
righteousness.&nbsp; Sometimes He stood single-handed against a multitude
of foes, they were often vacillating, cowardly, and inconsistent with
themselves; but not so the Saviour.&nbsp; With what authority did He rebuke
their selfishness, their duplicity, their sin; and yet how confidently <!--
page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>could
He appeal to His bitterest opponents as to the simplicity and purity of His
own character and life&mdash;&ldquo;Which of you convinceth <i>Me</i> of
sin?&rdquo;&nbsp; The proud and supercilious Pharisees sought &ldquo;to
entangle Him in His talk;&rdquo; they charged Him with blasphemy, with
disregard for the Sabbath, with breaking the law, and they disputed His
authority to act as He did; but their cunning could not ensnare, their
threatening could not intimidate.&nbsp; Satan sought by a threefold
temptation to turn Him aside; he desired Him to question, in the first
place, the providence of God, then to tempt an interposition of Providence
by exposing Himself to unnecessary danger, and finally to fall down and
worship him; but our Lord indignantly repelled the tempter, and maintained
His purity; and &ldquo;angels came and ministered unto Him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must work the works of Him that sent me,&rdquo; was the motto of
His life&mdash;the simple purpose of His mind; nor did He shrink from any
portion of that work however hazardous and difficult.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
meat,&rdquo; said He, &ldquo;is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to
finish His work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this simple purpose of the Saviour&rsquo;s mind and conduct we have a
beautiful example.&nbsp; Nothing is so difficult, in days like these, as
the maintenance of a pure and simple mind.&nbsp; Duplicity, <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>deception,
and selfishness pervade all ranks and conditions of men.&nbsp; You find
them in the shop, in the market-place, in the family, and alas! in the
church itself; and nothing but a resolute resistance, directed and
sustained by the grace of God, can make the Christian proof against these
evils.&nbsp; O imitate the Saviour.&nbsp; Mark out for yourselves a
definite line of conduct, consistent with your Christian profession, and
adhere to it firmly, in spite of custom or contempt, and in the prospect of
death itself.</p>
<p>Simplicity produces unity.&nbsp; There is nothing complex in the
character and life of Christ.&nbsp; Every part is in perfect keeping with
the whole.&nbsp; His teaching, His miracles, His conduct, illustrate each
other, and combine to prove His true Messiahship, and exhibit the
perfection of His life.&nbsp; If there were glaring inconsistencies in the
history of Jesus&mdash;if the four Evangelists had written documents which
could not be harmonized&mdash;if the moral teaching, and the moral conduct
of Christ were at variance&mdash;if His pretensions were not justified by
His works&mdash;then we might deny His Messiahship, and disregard Him as
our Great Example.&nbsp; But it is not so.&nbsp; What He taught He
practised; what He promised he performed; the work He came from heaven to
accomplish He actually &ldquo;finished,&rdquo; even to the shedding of <!--
page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>His
blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cup which my Father hath given me to drink,&rdquo;
said He, &ldquo;shall I not drink it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the example of
Christ forbids all fickleness and falsehood.&nbsp; It condemns all false
appearances; and says to all His followers, with an authority and force
which even the words themselves do not contain, &ldquo;Let your
communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these
cometh of evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a wonderful and glorious change would the
observance of such a rule effect in the church, and in the world!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; The mind of Christ is distinguished by its <i>sympathy</i>
and <i>ceaseless activity</i>.&nbsp; He could <i>weep</i> at the grave of
Lazarus, before calling back His friend to life.&nbsp; He could <i>stop</i>
at the gate of Nain, to cheer the heart of a bereaved widow, by restoring
to life her only son.&nbsp; He could condescend to <i>touch</i> the
loathsome leper, and thus make him clean.&nbsp; He could <i>stoop to hold a
conversation</i> with a penitent adulteress.&nbsp; He could <i>work a
miracle</i> to feed a hungry multitude.&nbsp; He could <i>look</i>
conviction into Peter&rsquo;s heart, and thus send the faithless Apostle
out of His presence weeping bitterly.&nbsp; O there was nothing cold,
ungenerous, or selfish in the nature of Christ.&nbsp; He was never too much
occupied to listen to the <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>tale of sorrow, nor too dignified to afford
relief.&nbsp; He was never unapproachable.&nbsp; The finest sensibilities,
the purest affections, the deepest sympathies were exhibited in actions,
which, had there been no ultimate purpose in His mission, would have marked
Him as a benefactor of our race, and carried down His name and His fame to
the latest posterity.&nbsp; And this, in a humbler degree, we are called
upon to imitate.&nbsp; How little like the Saviour is the man whose heart
is hard, whose temper is irritable, and who has no bowels of compassion for
the destitute and afflicted.&nbsp; How little like the Saviour is the man
who prides himself upon superior extraction or superior position, and looks
down with contempt upon the poor and the penniless.&nbsp; The Son of Man
came to seek, and to save the lost: and when John&rsquo;s disciples asked
Him for evidence that He was Christ, His reply was simply this: Go tell
your master the things which ye have seen and heard; &ldquo;the blind
receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the
deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the Gospel preached
unto them.&rdquo;&nbsp; What an outline is this of the Redeemer&rsquo;s
daily toil!&nbsp; How He &ldquo;went about doing good!&rdquo;&nbsp; How He
wandered among the cities and villages of Jud&aelig;a and Samaria; sharing
the rough hospitality of fishermen&mdash;<!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>the barley-bread of
the poorest peasant; working miracles of healing; teaching doctrines of
profoundest import; contending with His enemies, the Pharisees and Scribes;
and conducting the minds and the hearts of His disciples and the multitudes
away from their superstitions and their prejudices, to the heart of His
Father&rsquo;s love, and the results of His own suffering and sacrifice in
their behalf: nor did this sublime and ceaseless activity terminate until
He hung upon the cross&mdash;and then only to be renewed in ceaseless
intercession at His Father&rsquo;s throne.&nbsp; And again He left us an
example.&nbsp; This active sympathy is the very genius of our holy
religion&mdash;the spirit which it breathes&mdash;the life which it
lives&mdash;the pure and blessed element in which it grows and becomes
perfect.&nbsp; Happy is the man who thus imitates the Saviour&mdash;whose
&ldquo;weariness of life is gone,&rdquo; by the employment of his talents
and his time in &ldquo;doing and receiving good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; All these elements of character in Christ were directed and
sustained by the <i>holiness of His nature</i>.&nbsp; This is undeniable
His enemies being judges.&nbsp; Even devils testified to
this&mdash;&ldquo;We know Thee, who Thou art, the holy one of God;&rdquo;
they could not resist His Divine authority; they could not impeach His
human purity; and <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>in order to secure His condemnation at the
last, the chief-priests were compelled to resort to bribery and
falsehood.&nbsp; And ever since the bitterest opponents of His religion
have been constrained to reiterate Pilate&rsquo;s verdict with regard to
Himself&mdash;&ldquo;We find no fault in this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate aright the holiness of Christ as an example
to us.&nbsp; It is difficult to discover how far, or whether at all, the
Divinity of Christ acted on the humanity in relation to His holiness.&nbsp;
We believe, however, that the holiness of His humanity was altogether
distinct from His Godhead; and though He &ldquo;did no sin; neither was
guile found in His mouth,&rdquo; He was none the less exposed to
temptation; but amid the vanity and vice which everywhere abounded and
surrounded Him, He walked, and worked, and lived in the maintenance of that
holiness which we may imitate; not a holiness resulting from the union of
the Divine with the human, but a holiness belonging only to the
latter.&nbsp; Had He yielded to temptation, the whole of His mission would
have failed, His teaching would have had no force, His example would have
perished with His fame, and His death would have had no saving merit
whatsoever.&nbsp; But His holiness remained inviolate; and now it is the
ground and the pattern of ours.&nbsp; It is not enough that you <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>be meek and
lowly; it is not enough that you be simple and ingenuous; it is not enough
that you be sympathetic and affectionate; you must be <i>holy</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jesu&rsquo;s is a <i>spotless</i> mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brethren, suffer me to urge the exhortation of the text.&nbsp; O the
dignity, the blessedness of this conformity to Christ!&nbsp; Will you seek
it for yourselves.&nbsp; You and I are only Christians so far as we
resemble Christ, not a bit farther.&nbsp; Jesus is Himself the perfect
embodiment of His own teaching, the living, acting example of all those
elements of character and conduct which fit intelligent and immortal
spirits for the Paradise of God.&nbsp; Therefore, &ldquo;let this mind be
in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seek it! exhibit
it!!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
